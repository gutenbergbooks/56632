<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Oh</span>, two rooms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a fireplace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a <span class='it'>window-seat</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Two</span> window-seats!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These exclamations fell swiftly and explosively
from the lips of Dotty Rose and Dolly Fayre, as they
leaned over the table at which Mr. Rose was drawing
plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such plans! And for such a purpose!
Why, the whole project was nothing more nor less
than a house, a real little house for those two fortunate
girls! All their own, with fireplaces and window-seats
and goodness knows what all delightful
contrivances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had come about because of the fact that the
girls had to study pretty hard, now that they were
in High School, and both found difficulty in finding
just the right place to study. Dolly declared that
Trudy was always having company, and the laughter
and chatter was so permeating, she couldn’t find a
place in the house to get out of hearing the noise.
While Dotty said little Genie was always carrying
on with her young playmates, or else Mother and
Aunt Clara were having Sewing Society or something,
and she never could be quiet in the library.
The girls, of course, had their own bedrooms, but
both mothers objected, on hygienic grounds, to using
those for sitting-rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mr. Rose had cooked up a most fascinating
scheme, and after a discussion with Mr. Fayre, he
elucidated it to the girls. It seemed Mr. Fayre fully
approved of it, and was quite willing to pay his share
of the expense, but he was too busy to look after the
details of building, and begged Mr. Rose to attend
to all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rose, who was cashier of the Berwick Bank,
had plenty of leisure time, and, moreover, had a taste
for architecture, so the plans were in process of
drafting. As the house was to be exceedingly simple,
he felt he could plan it all himself, and thus save
the expense of an architect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said to his interested audience, “it
is really nothing but a summer house, only it is
enclosed, so as to be—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A winter-house!” interrupted Dotty. “Oh,
Daddy, it is too perfectly scrumptiousiferous! I
don’t see how I can live through such joy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s blue eyes sparkled, but her pleasure was
too deep for words, and she expressed it in long
drawn sighs, and occasional Oh’s!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say twenty feet by fifteen for the whole house,”
Mr. Rose said, musingly. “Then divide that in
halves. Thus we have a front room, a sort of living
room, ten by fifteen. Quite big enough, for in addition
we can have a deep window-seat at each end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where we can curl up in to study!” cried Dotty.
“Oh, Dollyrinda, did you ever <span class='it'>dream</span> anything so
perfect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never did! And what is in the other room, Mr.
Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a sort of dining-room, say ten by ten of it,
and that will leave a neat little five by ten for a bit
of a kitchenette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ooh—eeh—I can’t take it all in! A kitchenette!
Where we can make fudge and cook messes—oh,
Dad-dy!” Dotty threw her arms around her
father’s neck, and in her great gratitude, Dolly did
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, the dining-room isn’t exactly
for an eating room exclusively, but I know you will
enjoy having little teas there with your friends, or
taffy pulls or whatever the fad is nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed we can,” said Dolly; “we can all go
there after skating and have hot chocolate and sandwiches!
Maybe it won’t be fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is primarily for study,” warned Mr. Rose.
“I don’t think though, you two bookworms will neglect
your lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right, for both Dolly and Dotty were
studious, and now, being in the High School, they
were most anxious to make good records. They
studied diligently every evening, and though Dotty
learned her lessons more quickly, Dolly remembered
hers better. But both were fond of fun and frolic,
and they foresaw wonderful opportunities in the new
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a piazza!” squealed Dotty, as under her
father’s clever fingers a wide piazza showed on the
paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course; this will be a summer house also,
you know, and a piazza is a necessity. Perhaps in
the winter it can be enclosed with glass. All such
details must come later. First we must get the proportions
and the main plan. And here it is, in a
nutshell. Or, rather, in a rectangle. Just half is
the living-room, and the other half is two-thirds dining-room
and one-third kitchen. The kitchen includes
kitchenette and pantry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is a kitchenette, exactly?” asked Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only what its name implies,” returned Mr. Rose,
smiling. “Just a little kitchen. There will be a gas
stove,—no, I think it would be better for you to
have it all electric. Then you can have an electric
oven and toaster and chafing-dish, and any such contraptions
you want. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too good to be true!” and Dolly sighed in deep
contentment. “How long will it take to build it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not long, if I can get the workmen to go right
at it, and I hope I can. Now, suppose we plan the
living-room, which is, of course, the study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s call it the Study,” said Dolly. “Sounds
sort of wise and grown-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Here then, in the Study, suppose
we have the door right in the middle of the front
wall, and opening on the front veranda. Then a
small window each side of the door, and a big square
bay, with cushioned seat, at each end of the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glorious!” and Dolly danced about on one foot.
“Then we can each have one of them to study in,
every afternoon after school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a blazing wood fire—where’s the fireplace,
Daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, opposite the entrance door. Then you
see, one chimney in the middle of the house, will provide
for a fireplace in each room. I’m not sure this
will give you heat enough. If not, you must depend
on gas logs. We can’t be bothered with a furnace
of any sort. Perhaps in the very coldest weather
you can’t inhabit your castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that won’t matter,” and Dolly’s good-natured
face smiled brightly; “if we have it most of
the time, we’ll willingly study somewhere else on extra
cold days. And at one side of the fireplace, the door
through to the dining-room—oh, yes, I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, my child. And on the other side of the
fireplace, in the Study, a set of built-in bookshelves,
and in the dining-room, a built-in glass closet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we haven’t any glass!” and Dotty looked
amazed at the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I dare say the mothers of you will scout
around and give you some old junk from the attics.
I know of a gorgeous dish you can have.” Mr.
Rose’s eyes twinkled, and Dotty broke into laughter:
“I know! you mean ‘The Eyesore’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a hideous affair that some one had sent
Mrs. Rose as a Christmas Gift, and the family had
long since relegated it to the oblivion of a dark cupboard.
“No, thank you!” Dot went on, “I’d
rather have things from the ten-cent store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have some awfully nice things there,” suggested
Dolly, “and I know Mother has a lot of odds
and ends we can have. Oh, when the house is built,
it will be lots of fun to furnish it. Trudy will make
us lovely table-covers and things like that. And we
can have paper napkins for our spreads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Aunt Clara says she will make all the curtains,—whatever
sort we want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s lovely of her! I know we’ll have lots of
things given to us, and we’ll find lots of things around
our homes—and the rest we’ll do ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and Thomas will bring wood for us, and
take away the ashes. We must have enormous wood-baskets
or wood-boxes. Oh, it’s just like furnishing
a real house! What loads of fun we’ll have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, in the kitchen,” Mr. Rose went on, drawing
as he spoke, “we’ll have a tiny sink, all nice white
enamel, and a wall-cupboard for your dish-towels
and soap and such things. Also a sort of a small—a
very small—kitchen cabinet for your pepper and
salt, with a place underneath for pans and kettles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think a lot about the kitchen, Daddy. I believe
you expect to come there sometimes to join our
feasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly shall, if I’m invited. Then, you see,
the dining-room can have a deep window, and if you
don’t care for a window-seat there, how about a
window-box of bright flowers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that, Mr. Rose,” demurred
Dolly. “If the house isn’t always warm, the poor
posies would freeze, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are, Dollykins. Cut out the growing
plants, then, and have now and then a vase or bowl
of flowers on the table. Now, let me see. An electric
light over the table in the dining-room, and
perhaps a side light or two. Then in the Study, a
reading light for each, and one or two pretty fixtures
beside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, will we use it so much at night, Mr.
Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you choose to. And anyway, in the winter
time, you’ll need lights by five o’clock, or on dark
days, even earlier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so; how thoughtful you are. I s’pose
some days we won’t go in the house at all, and others
we’ll be there all the afternoon and all the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all Saturdays,” said Dotty; “we’ll always
spend Saturdays there, and we can make things for
the house or make our Christmas presents, or make
fudge and have the girls and boys come over—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or just sit by the fire and read,” interrupted
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you old kitten! You’d rather lie by the fire
and purr than do anything at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then I’ll do that. We’re to do whatever
we please in our own house, aren’t we, Mr.
Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Dolly. But amicable always. No,
I don’t think you two are inclined to quarrel, but you
do have little differences now and then, and I’d hate
to have the charm of this little nest disturbed by
foolish squabbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll promise, for one, <span class='it'>never</span> to scrap,” said Dolly,
eagerly, and Dotty said with equal fervour, “Me,
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have nice, plain, hard floors,” continued
Mr. Rose, “and I’m sure your mothers can find some
discarded rugs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we can make those,” exclaimed Dolly.
“Don’t you know, Dot, that new way your Aunt
Clara told us about? You take rags, you know, and
sew them in pipings, and then crochet them,—oh, it’s
just lovely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. We’ll each make one of those, it’ll
be fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ll put them in the Study, one on each
side of the room. Yours on my side, mine on
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Which side do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the side next my house and you the side
next yours. Then if our mothers call us, we can
hear them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” said Mr. Rose. “I think we’ll put
the house just on the dividing line between your
father’s ground and mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mother can hang a red flag out the window
if she wants me in a hurry. Or if dinner is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might have a telephone,” suggested Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that later,” said Mr. Rose.
“You must remember that the expenses are counting
up, and Mr. Fayre and I are not millionaires. But
we want you to have a good substantial little nook
for yourselves. Then, later, if we see fit to add a
telephone or a wireless apparatus or an airship garage,
we can do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” returned Dotty with a satisfied grin.
“Say, Doll, shall we bring our desks from our bedrooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Mr. Rose answered for her. “Those are
too flimsy and dainty; and besides, you’ll need them
where they are. I shall ask the privilege of contributing
two solid, sensible Mission desks of greenish
tinge, with chairs to match. Then if you want to
curl up on your window cushions to study you may,
but there will be a place to write your compositions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely, Father! How good you are!” and
Dotty fell on his neck, while Dolly possessed herself
of his hand and patted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls were equally fond of their fathers,
but Mr. Rose was more chummy in manner than Mr.
Fayre. The latter was devoted to his children, but
was less demonstrative of his affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly well knew that her father would not be
outdone in kindness or generosity and that he would
give an equally welcome gift, as well as pay his share
of the building expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mr. Rose,” she said, “if you do that,
I’m sure father will furnish the dining-room with
whatever we want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be much needed for that, just a table
and chairs, which can doubtless be snared in our
attics. But your father, Dotty, offered the whole
kitchenette outfit, which, I can tell you, is a noble
gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it is!” cried Dotty. “I’m crazy to get
at that electricky-cooky business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I,” declared Dolly. “When will it be all
done, Mr. Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say exactly. If all goes well you ought
to get in by the last of October.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About Hallowe’en, then,” said Dolly. “We
might have a kind of Hallowe’en party for a house-warming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gay!” cried Dotty. “We’ll get all our
treasures in it by that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s call it our Treasure House,—how’s that
for a name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty good,” said Mr. Rose. “I’ve been wondering
what to call it. Treasure House isn’t bad at
all. Makes you think of Treasure Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so it does,” and Dolly’s blue eyes sparkled
at the name of one of her best-loved books. “Oh,
won’t it be fun to arrange our bookshelves. I’m
glad to move some of my books, my shelves at home
are overrunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, you see, children,” Mr. Rose was still
adding to his drawings, “in the summer, you can
have hammocks on the veranda, and piazza-boxes
with flowers—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Daddy, dear, you <span class='it'>shall</span> get those flower-boxes
set up as soon as the gentle Spring gets
around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do love flowers,” and Mr. Rose smiled,
for his family well knew his great fondness for gardening.
“Now you girls won’t have any too much
time to get your flummerydiddles ready. For after
the house is built and papered and painted, you ought
to have your furnishings all ready. And to make
curtains and cushions and lace whatd’y’callums—tidies?
will be a few weeks’ work,—won’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeedy. But all our beloved lady relatives
will help us and among our sisters and our mothers
and our aunts, I ’spect we’ll accumulate about enough
housekeeping stuff to stock a hotel.” Dotty danced
around the table as she talked, and catching Dolly
in her arms, the two executed a sort of triumphal
hoppity-skip that expressed their joy and relieved
their feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” sighed Dolly, suddenly looking
thoughtful, “I’ve got to go right straight, smack
home and do my Geometry for to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my goodness! me too!” exclaimed Dotty.
“Dear! how I wish Treasure House was done, and I
could go there to study. It’s an awful long time
to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can make things every chance we get.
Oh, Dotty, I’m going to make a birch-bark scrapbasket.
I’ve got a lot of that bark left that I
brought down from Crosstrees. Won’t it be fine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great! Shall we have two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, only one scrapbasket and such things. It’s
more cosy. But two of everything that we use separately.
Like two desks, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one set of bookshelves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’ll be nooks for books, beside the fireplace,
and beside the window casings,” said Mr. Rose,
“in addition to the regular shelves. I haven’t half
fixed those things up yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it will be just heavenly!” sighed Dolly.
“But I must scoot to my Geometry now. See you
to-morrow, Dot. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Good-bye.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A JOKE AT SCHOOL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> the two D’s reached school next morning, they
found a group of their friends giggling and whispering
in a corner of the Recreation Room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the joke?” asked Dotty as they drew
near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Two D’s,” cried Tod Brown. “How are
you, Toodies? Just wait till you hear what’s up!
The greatest sell ever! The biggest joke of the
season. Oh, me, oh, my!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us,” begged Dolly. “Tell us, Tod, what
is it?” She was taking off her hat and coat as she
talked, and as she stepped into the coatroom to hang
them up, Celia Ferris slipped in and whispered to her.
“Now don’t jump on the scheme, Dolly Fayre.
You’re such a goody-goody, I’m half afraid to let you
in on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, is it mean?” and Dolly’s blue eyes flashed,
for she hated a mean joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t mean, at least no meaner than she
deserves. But I wish they wouldn’t tell you; you’re
an old spoilsport, and I know you’ll say you won’t
join in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Join in what? Do tell me, or I can’t say <span class='it'>what</span>
I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on out. Tod will tell you,” and the two
girls joined the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Tod?” asked Dolly, as she came
up to the laughing boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dollykin, do be real nice and don’t be a
horrid old Miss Prim! You see, Miss Partland, the
Geometry teacher, is so cross and horrid and unjust
to us, we’re going to pay her out. And we’ve
thought up the greatest scheme! Just listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, let me tell her,” said Joe Collins; “you’ll
make it seem worse’n it is. Why, Doll, it’s only this.
You see, Miss Partland isn’t looking very well, and
we are all going to tell her so. She ought to know
the truth. And she keeps a lot of us in every afternoon,
and we don’t want her to. So we’re each going
to tell her, as we get the chance, that she looks sort of
ill, and then, we think she’ll want to go home early,
herself, and she won’t stay to keep us in. Isn’t that
all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that doesn’t seem very bad,” said Dolly,
dimpling as she smiled. “How are you going to
bring it in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just casually, you know. If you have a
chance, you just say, ‘Aren’t you feeling well, Miss
Partland?’ or something like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d just as lieve say that, if she looks ill; but I
won’t if she doesn’t,” returned Holly, very decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; you’ll find she looks ill. Why, the
poor lady is on the verge of nervous prostration, and
so will we all be, if she is so hard on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she keep you in, yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep; just ’cause I had a little mite of a mistake
in one example! Oh, she’s the limit, she is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you think she’ll be any sweeter-natured
if we sympathise with her for feeling bad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe; you never can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s a grand scheme!” declared Dotty.
“She’s an old fuss anyway. She found fault with
my examples because I didn’t take a separate sheet
of paper for each one. I’d just as lieve, only I didn’t
know she wanted me to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your house comin’ on, Dot?” sang out
Lollie Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly great! It’ll be done by Hallowe’en,
and maybe we won’t have one rollicking good time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t we just! You want to look out, you
know Hallowe’en is the time for tricks, and I dunno
what the boys will get off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in our new house! If anybody takes our
doors off of their hinges or does anything mean, I
won’t stand it, that’s all!” and Dotty shook her
curly black head and her dark eyes sparkled with
anger at the thought of such desecration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, look out, that’s all,” said Lollie, teasingly,
and then the bell called them to the schoolroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after they all trooped to a classroom for the
Geometry lesson. As he passed the teacher’s desk,
Tod Brown tripped against her platform, and nearly
fell over on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a clumsy boy!” exclaimed Miss Partland,
frowning, and indeed the stumble was an awkward
one. Small wonder, as it was done entirely on purpose!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tod straightened himself up, made a nice, boyish
bow, and said, “Please excuse me, Miss Partland.
Oh, don’t feel alarmed, I’m not hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m not alarmed, you silly boy! I am annoyed
at you, not sorry for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m. But, Miss Partland, you’re so white.
Why, you look quite ill! Mayn’t I get you a glass
of water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to your seat!” Miss Partland turned scarlet,
both from irritation at Tod’s speech, and a sudden
nervous fear for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tod went to his place, and when it was Tad’s turn
to go to the blackboard, he paused a moment, and
looked straight into the teacher’s face. “Why,
Miss Partland,” he whispered to her, “don’t you
feel well? You look awful queer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to the board,” she said, but she was evidently
disturbed at his remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tad went obediently, and did his work well, then,
as he returned to his seat, he gave Miss Partland a
long, searching look, and gravely shook his head.
The other pupils saw him, and saw, too, that the
teacher looked worried. The joke was working.
Surely, she would not stay to-night to keep anybody
in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next was Dotty’s turn. She went toward the
blackboard, but on the way, she stopped in front of
Miss Partland, and looked at her. Then, with an
anxious look on her face, she stepped up on the platform,
and whispering in the teacher’s ear, said: “If
you’re not feeling well, Miss Partland, why don’t you
go to the rest room for a while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m perfectly well, child, what’s the matter with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look so,” said Dotty, shaking her
head, and looking back at her victim, as she moved
slowly to the board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several others did similarly; some not commenting
on the teacher’s looks, but merely staring at her, and
then looking away quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly Fayre had not noticed much of the whole
performance, for she was behind with her lesson, and
was struggling with a refractory problem, hoping to
get it done before she had to go to the blackboard
to demonstrate it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, when she rose from her seat, she was surprised
and shocked to see how alarmed Miss Partland
looked. Indeed the poor lady was all upset with bewilderment
at the observations made by her pupils.
She had begun to think there must be something
serious and noticeable the matter with her. She was
trembling with nervous apprehension, and was on
the verge of tears. And so, Dolly, who had forgotten
Tod’s joke, said, most honestly, “Why, what
<span class='it'>is</span> the matter, Miss Partland? You look awfully
ill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other pupils, hearing this, chuckled silently,
thinking what a good little actress Dolly was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to Miss Partland it was the last straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ill,” she cried out; “very ill. Help me,
Dolly, to the rest room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning on the shoulder of Dolly, who was pretty
well frightened, Miss Partland stumbled along to the
rest room,—a place provided for any one suddenly
indisposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly assisted her teacher to lie down on a couch,
and dipping her handkerchief in cold water, held it
to her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me call somebody,” said Dolly. “I don’t
know what I ought to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I feel better now,” said Miss Partland.
“But I can’t go back to the classroom. I think I
must go home. You may go to Mr. Macintosh,
Dolly, and tell him I went home, ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Partland,” replied Dolly, and then it
suddenly came to her, that this was the result of
Tod’s joke! “Were you ill this morning?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not in the slightest. It is a sudden attack
of some sort. Perhaps I shall die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. You’ll be all right in an hour or so.
What sort of pain do you feel, Miss Partland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any definite pain. But queer all over, as if
some illness were impending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do believe, thought Dolly to herself, that it’s all
the fault of those horrid boys, telling her she looked
ill! And then she suddenly remembered that she herself
had told Miss Partland so, too, and very emphatically.
But she had told her in earnest, while the
others had been carrying out their jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, her comment was just the same as theirs,
and doubtless helped to produce this effect. She
wondered what to do. At first, she thought she
would tell the whole story, and let the boys and girls
take the consequences of their ill-timed joke. Then,
she feared it might so enrage Miss Partland to know
of it, that it would make her worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She decided not to tell at present, anyway, and she
helped the teacher on with her hat and coat, and went
with her to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Mr. Macintosh I am quite ill,” she said as
she went away. And Dolly went to the Principal’s
room to do her bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Miss Partland say what the trouble was?”
asked the surprised man. “Is she subject to these
attacks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t say, Mr. Macintosh, and I have never
known her to be ill before. I think she will be all
right, to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know a great deal for a miss of
your age! Have you had much experience with
heart attacks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say it was a heart attack,” said poor
Dolly, torn by her knowledge of what had really
caused the trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been, from what you say. That’s
what I mean, you are too young and inexperienced to
attend alone on a suffering victim of heart disease.
Why didn’t you call some help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did want to, sir, but Miss Partland wouldn’t
let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go. Return to the class and tell them
they are dismissed. Let them all go to their next
recitation at the proper time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Macintosh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop a minute.” Dolly turned. “Do you
know anything more about this affair than you have
told me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly hesitated. What should she do? She did
know more about it; she knew of the joke the boys
had made up, and she felt almost sure that it was
owing to this foolish jest that Miss Partland had
imagined she felt ill so vividly, that at last she really
did feel so. And yet, if Dolly “peached” on the
boys, she well knew what they would think of her!
It was a hard position. But, she thought quickly,
it couldn’t help Miss Partland to tell of the joke now,
and then again the illness might not have been caused
by the joke after all, Dolly had been so engrossed
with her difficult problem that she had not seen the
successive boys and girls look at Miss Partland with
such evident sympathy, anxiety and even consternation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hesitation naturally made the Principal think
she was withholding some information of importance,
and he said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Macintosh,” said Dolly, firmly; “I do
not feel sure that I am. The only thing I know, is
not positively connected with Miss Partland’s illness,
although it may be. But as I am not sure, I am
not justified in even speaking of it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Principal looked at her attentively. “You’re
a queer child,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am,” replied Dolly, thoughtfully. “But
I’m trying to see what is my duty, and I can’t say
anything till I find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, you’re an honest little girl, and I
don’t believe you know anything that you really
ought to tell, or you’d tell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, sir. That’s just it. I <span class='it'>don’t</span>
think I ought to, or I <span class='it'>would</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismissed from the room, Dolly returned to the
class and told them the lesson would not be resumed
that day, as Miss Partland had gone home ill. She
looked reproachfully at the boys who had been ring-leaders
in the “joke” and at Celia Ferris, too, who
had also been a party to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as there were many in the class who knew
nothing about it, no word was said then and there,
nor could there be until after school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dolly told what had happened. “And to
think,” she concluded, “that Miss Partland was not
ill at all, but so many remarks on her looking poorly,
made her think she was,—and then—she was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, nonsense!” said Lollie Henry; “you can’t
make a lady ill by telling her she doesn’t look quite
up to the mark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you can,” declared Dolly. “It’s what they
call auto-suggestion, or something. Just the same
way, if you tell anybody they look well, why, then
they get well. I’ve heard Mother talk about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” said Tod Brown, “all we’ve got to
do, is to go around to Miss Partland’s house and tell
her she’s looking as blooming as a peach!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” said Tad. “That’s dead easy. Come
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dolly, “you can’t rush off like that!
You’d probably make her worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what does she want, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tad, you’re so silly!” and Dolly couldn’t
help laughing at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re silly, Dolly,” said Celia. “I
don’t believe it was our joke that upset her, at all.
I believe she’d been sick anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she wouldn’t. She said she was perfectly
well this morning. You know, Celia, that it was
your speeches, one after another, that scared her into
thinking she was ill. And it was enough to, too!
Why, I wasn’t noticing at the time, I was studying,
but Dot told me afterward, how you all told her she
looked so terrible, and you pretended to be scared to
death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you said the same thing to her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I meant it! By the time I went up to
the board, you had all frightened her so, she was
white and shaky-looking. I was sure she was going
to faint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dolly was in earnest,” said Dotty. “If
we did any harm, Doll can’t be included. When she
said that to Miss Partland, it was true. When we
said it, it wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not sticking myself up,” began Dolly.
“And I’m not blaming the rest of you. I think it
was a mean joke, but never mind that now. What
I’m thinking of is what we ought to do. Seems if
we ought to set matters right somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” said Celia. “It’s always better
to let well enough alone, my mother says. I bet
that by to-morrow morning, Miss Partland will be
all right and will have forgotten all about this foolishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bet she will too,” said Lollie. “Say, Dolly,
don’t worry over it. It wasn’t your fault anyway.
And I don’t believe it will make old Party really ill.
It couldn’t. And it may make her more sweet-tempered
if she thinks she’s subject to—what d’y’ call
em?—heart attacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know it was a heart attack?” demanded
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard Mr. Macintosh tell another teacher that
Miss Party had gone home because she had a heart
attack in the classroom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it was her heart at all,” said
Dolly slowly. “Why should any one think so? It
was only nervousness, caused by your foolish trick.
I’m sorry for Miss Partland. If she isn’t all right
to-morrow, I’m going to tell her the whole story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meany!” cried Celia; “it’s awful mean to tell
tales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so mean as to play tricks!” retorted Dolly,
and then she and Dotty had reached their homes, and
went in, while the others went on their way.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AN AFTERNOON CALL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dolly</span> worried a good deal over her teacher’s illness,
and when Miss Partland was not at school the next
day, she decided to go to see her, on the way home.
The boys tried to dissuade her, but Dolly was firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use trying to steer off Dolly Fayre, if she’s
made up her mind,” said Lollie Henry. “If she has
a bee in her bonnet, she sticks to it like a puppy to
a root.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all laughed at this, but Dotty said, earnestly,
“Don’t go, Doll; you’ll have to tell on the boys and
girls, and that will be awful mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t. I’ve a plan of my own, and I won’t
say a word about your playing a joke, or anything
about any of you. But I do think, Lollie, and you
Tad and Tod too, that it’s a mean, horrid thing to
play practical jokes, and I think you <span class='it'>ought</span> to be
told on,—but I won’t tell on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now, Dolly, Towhead Dolly, don’t be hard on
us,” said Tad, in such a wheedlesome way that Dolly
had to laugh. “We didn’t mean any real harm,
and she <span class='it'>has</span> been awfully cross to us, and we’re not
such angels of goodness as you are—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not an angel of goodness, Tad Brown, and
I’ll thank you to stop making fun of me! But I do
believe in being decent to a teacher, even if she is
strict in her rules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Dolly,” said Dotty, as they neared the
street where Miss Partland lived; “if you’re going,
I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ho!” jeered Lollie, “<span class='it'>two</span> little angels of
goodness, little white angels, with shiny wings!
Well, fly into old Party’s house, and see what’s the
matter with her,—mumps or measles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls went to the house, and were invited
to go up to the teacher’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found Miss Partland, sitting in an easy
chair, looking disconsolate indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, girls?” she said, listlessly;
“won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two D’s sat down, and Dolly said, at once,
“Oh, I’m glad to see you looking so much better,
Miss Partland! You’re not really ill, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Dolly,” and the poor lady looked
sadly distraught. She was not an interesting invalid
in appearance. She had on an old grey flannel
wrapper, and her hair was untidy. A bowl of broth,
cold,—and one or two bottles were on her table,
and the whole room had an unkempt, uncared-for air.
“You see,” she went on, “I didn’t know I had heart
trouble, and it worries me terribly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know it yet?” asked Dolly. “Have
you had a doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve sent for him, but he hasn’t come yet. But
several people have called or telephoned, and they
all speak of my heart attack, so I think it must have
been that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty looked very serious, and blushed a little as
she realised to what a pass their thoughtless joke
had brought the teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Partland,” Dolly went on. “I don’t believe
it was your heart, or you’d be sicker now. You
don’t feel bad, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,—I guess not,—I can hardly tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you look real well to me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do I? I’m glad to hear you say so. I
thought myself, if it were anything serious, I’d feel
worse than I do. I haven’t any real pain, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good; and I believe all you want is to
brace up and forget it. Forget that little bother of
yesterday, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Miss Partland,” broke in Dotty, “won’t
you let me do your hair in a new way that I’ve just
tried on mother’s? I often do her hair for her, and
she says it rests her a lot. And this new way—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy, child, I never had anybody touch my
hair in my life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t know how it helps. Just let
me try. Where’s your comb? and hairpins? Oh,
here they are. No, don’t face the mirror, I want
you to be surprised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty bustled around, and almost before Miss
Partland knew it, she was having her hair dressed
by the skilful little hands. The hair was not long or
luxurious, but it was of fine texture, and when released
from the tight little knob it was wound in,
proved slightly wavy. Dot made the most of it,
and drawing it up in a soft French twist, she puffed
it out at the sides, and made a most becoming and
transforming coiffure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” she said, “you’re real pretty now, and
I’d like to see anybody say you look sick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Partland looked in the glass and was astounded.
The unwonted performance had brought
the colour to her cheeks, and interest to her eyes,
and when she saw the whole effect in the mirror, she
fairly beamed with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, haven’t you a nicer kimono, or dressing
gown? This isn’t very pretty for afternoon, and
the doctor coming and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Partland looked amazed. “I never thought
about it,” she said; “I haven’t any other,—or, that
is—yes, I have one my sister sent me for Christmas,
but I’ve never worn it. It’s too nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mayn’t we see it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Partland went to the closet and brought out
a big box. From it she took a beautiful Japanese
kimono of pale blue silk, embroidered with pink
chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” she said, “you see I couldn’t wear
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” cried Dolly. “It’s lovely! And
it just suits your blonde colouring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was stretching the point a little, for Miss
Partland’s blondeness was of the type known as ash,
and her faded complexion and dull light blue eyes
hardly deserved the name of colouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly was sincere, and she meant to make the
most of what little natural vanity the lady possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” chimed in Dotty. “That’s too
pretty to be buried in an old dark closet! Put it
on, quick, before the doctor gets here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little bewildered, Miss Partland hurried into
the robe, and the girls were astounded at the becomingness
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well!” cried Dotty. “Try our plans, and
you will be surprised at the result! Why, Miss Partland,
you’re a hummer! A regular peach! Isn’t
she, Doll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes-sir-ee!” And Dolly patted the blue silk approvingly.
Then they wound the blue sash, that belonged
to the robe, round about her, and tucked the
ends in in Chinese fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must put that on every day after school,”
said Dotty, “it’s lovely on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s too nice. I never dreamed of wearing
it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, just you wear it, and when it’s worn
out I ’spect sister’ll give you another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she would, she’s awfully fond of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d be fonder, if she could see you now.
Clothes make a heap of difference,” and Dotty
nodded her head sagely. “My goodness, here’s the
doctor! I hear his automobile stopping. Yes, it
is,” as she peeped from the window. “Shall we go
home, Miss Partland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, just go in the next room, and after he’s
gone, I’ll tell you what he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, I do want to know,” said Dolly,
and the two ran into the next room and shut the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little time later, Miss Partland opened the door
and summoned them. She was smiling and so happy
looking that she was almost pretty,—a word rarely
used in connection with the Geometry teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, girls,” she said. “The doctor says
I have no heart trouble of any sort, and that I am
as sound as a dollar!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say what ailed you yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said I was probably nervous over some trifle,
but he said it had left no trace, for my nerves are
all right now. And, what do you think? He said
that as I had enough interest in life to take some
pains with my toilette, I was in no danger of nervous
prostration! And just think! Before you two
came in, I was wondering whether I’d better go to a
sanitarium!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Partland! Not really!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, really. I thought my whole nervous system
was shattered. Everybody said I looked so ill,
and they gave me such commiserating glances—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they won’t any more,” interrupted Dotty,
who was cut to the soul by these remarks. Well
she knew whose suggestions and whose glances had
brought about the sad state of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said practical Dolly, “I’m going to
straighten up this room a little. You may have
more callers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whisked away the bowl and bottles into the
bathroom. She straightened the shades, dusted a
little, and with a few deft touches here and there,
she made the room tidy and neat. She found a glass
vase which she washed, and setting it on the table,
said, “We must go now, Miss Partland, but I’m
going to send you a few flowers, and I want you to
put them in this vase, and set them right here on the
table, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I will, you dear child. You’re dear little
girls, both, and I can’t tell you how grateful I
am to you for your pleasant call. I can’t promise
to wear this elaborate gown every day, but I will
buy myself one that is more presentable than the
one I had on when you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have it pretty, Miss Partland,” begged
Dolly; “pretty things keep you from getting
sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if they do, you little rascal; how do
you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe they wouldn’t keep you from getting
chicken pox, they didn’t me, but I’m just sure
they’re good for nervous prostration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit,” and Miss Partland
smiled brightly as she bade the girls good-bye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m going to get her some flowers,” said
Dolly as they reached the street. “I haven’t much
left of my allowance, but I can get her half a dozen
carnations or two roses. Which would you, Dot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carnations, I guess. They last longer. I’m
going to get her a couple of fruits. Say, a grapefruit
and an orange, how’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! I’m glad you thought of it. It’ll cheer
her a lot. I say, Dot, we did do her some good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say we did! But it was all your doing,
I just went along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! You did as much as I did. Why,
I don’t know how you ever thought of fussing up her
hair! It was just the thing, but it never would have
occurred to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno myself how I happened to think of it.
But her old head looked so frowsy and untidy, I
wanted to see if it would make a difference. And it
did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so! Here’s the fruit store. Going
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went in, and Dotty made a judicious selection
of two oranges and a bunch of white grapes,
as they were not sure Miss Partland cared for grapefruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if any one <span class='it'>doesn’t</span> like it,” said Dotty, making
a wry face, “they don’t like it all over! <span class='it'>I</span> can’t
abide it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love it,” returned Dolly, “but as you say,
Dot, if people don’t like it they don’t. Grapes are
much safer. Now, come on to the flower shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half dozen carnations of an exquisite shade were
available for the money Dolly had, and it was with
great satisfaction she saw them put in a box and
sent off at once to Miss Partland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Dolly, you’re an awful trump!” declared
Dotty, as they walked along. “I never should have
thought of going to fix things up with old Party.
And now, I’m awful glad we did. Why is it, you
always have these good thinks and I never do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. Sometimes it makes me mad though
when the boys call me goody-goody. And Celia
Ferris said I was a spoilsport. That isn’t very nice
to be called, Dot, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but you always come out all right. You
see, I’m full of the dickens, and when the boys want
me to cut up jinks, I go into it head over heels without
thinking. You hesitate, and think it over and
then you do the right thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. Sometimes I think maybe I
<span class='it'>am</span> an old Primmy, as Tad calls me. Hello, here’s
Tad now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tad Brown met them as he came flying round a
corner, closely followed by his twin brother Tod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, girls,” Tad called out. “Been to old
Party’s? How is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right,” and Dolly laughed gaily.
“She’s had the doctor and he says her heart’s sound
as a dollar. So you see your old joke didn’t hurt
her, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it would have,” put in Dotty, “if Doll
hadn’t gone there and chirked her up, and told her
she wasn’t sick at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You went too,” said Dolly, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ’course. Whithersoever thou goest, theresoever
will I also went. And say, boys, you’ve got
to be gooder’n pie to-morrow, and every day, to
make up to old Party for your badness. She’s a
funny old thing, but she’s nice, and since I’ve seen
her at home, I feel different toward her, more intimate
like and sorry for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Tad, heartily. “I’m ready to
be good. I’m pretty well ashamed of that old joke
business, since it turned out so badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, too,” and Tod shook his head. “I thought
it was funny at first, but it didn’t pan out well. I’ll
never play another joke on anybody! any way, not
till the next time. Going to the High School Dance,
girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeedy!” and Dolly’s eyes glistened.
“Won’t it be fun? It is the first time I’ve ever been
to an evening party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go with me?” and Tod paused in the street, and
swept his best dancing-school bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, I don’t know,” said Dolly, overcome
at this sudden grown-upness. “I don’t believe
mother will let me go with a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, she will,” said Tad. “Just to a school
dance. You go with Tod, Dolly; and, Dot, you go
with me, and then we’ll be all in the same boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to,” said Dolly, “but I’m sure mother
won’t let me. What do you think, Dot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think my mother will muchly object at first,
but I think I can coax her into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, all the girls will go with the boys,” said
Tad eagerly. “They always do. You see our
bunch has never been in High School before, and
when we’re in Rome we must do as the Turkeys do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is going with who else, that you know of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Celia Ferris is going with Lollie Henry, and
Joe Collins—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what about Joe Collins?” asked Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is, too; what made you stop short?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you must know, he said he was going to
ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you boys talk it all over,—about who
you’ll take, I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we do,” said Tod, grinning. “I gave Joe
my new knife if he’d let me ask you first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t!” and Dolly looked shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course he didn’t!” said Tad. “Don’t
you let him fool you, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quartette had walked along to the Fayres’
house, and the boys wanted to go in and see how
the house was coming on. But Dolly wouldn’t allow
this, as she said she must study her lessons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you must all go home and study,” she said
shaking her golden head at them. “I want you to
have good lessons to-morrow, and cheer Miss Party
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell her she’s looking blooming,” said Tad,
laughing over his shoulder as he went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell her she’s a perfect peach!” declared
Tod, and then with gay good-byes they parted.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE HIGH SCHOOL DANCE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Oh</span>, I don’t know,” said Mrs. Fayre, doubtfully,
when Dolly asked her about going to the dance with
Tod. “You’re not old enough to go to an evening
party with an escort. Why, you’re only fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is a school party, Mumsie, and it seems
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Trudy. “I went to High
School parties with the boys when I was fifteen,—or
sixteen, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sixteen seems so much older. Why, Dolly’s
wearing hair-ribbons yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” and Trudy laughed, “they’ll allow hair
ribbons at a High School dance. Why, Mother, it’s
part of the course, in a way. It teaches the boys
and girls how to behave in Society—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly can learn that at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless she has lots of parties and dances,
I mean party manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m willing she should go, but I don’t like
her going with Tod Brown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’s an awfully nice boy. The Browns
are among the best people of Berwick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that, Trudy,—Tod’s all right. But I
think your father ought to take Dolly and go after
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother, they don’t do that nowadays. But
Dolly can go in our car, and stop for Tod, that
would be all right. And Thomas could go and bring
them home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That seems to me a very queer way to do. But
we’ll see what your father says about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayre, appealed to, was helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless my soul, Edith,” he said to his wife,
“I don’t know about such things. When I was a
boy, we went home with the girls, of course. But
nowadays I suppose the ways are different. You
women folks ought to be able to settle that question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are, Daddy,” said Dolly, sidling up to him,
and patting his hand. “But I’d just as lieve you’d
take me, if you want the bother of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind the bother, Chickadee, if it’s necessary.
But when you <span class='it'>do</span> get old enough to let the
Brownies take you to parties, I shan’t be sorry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I’ll settle the matter,” said Mrs.
Fayre, smiling at her younger daughter. “This
time, let Daddy take you, and the next time we’ll see
about it. You <span class='it'>are</span> growing up, I suppose, and, too,
one has to do as other people do. But this first
dance, I’d rather you went with father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mumsie, I’m willing. I don’t s’pose
it’ll be much of a party anyhow. Just the school
girls and boys, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Trudy. “When I went
to High, dances were pretty nice affairs. What
shall she wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Fayre. “I’ll have
to ask the mothers of some of the other girls how
much they dress. A white frock, I should think, with
some flowers or ribbons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was satisfied with the outcome of the discussion,
but quite another scene was being enacted
next door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to the High School Dance with Tad
Brown,” Dotty announced at the dinner table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” returned her
mother. “A child of your age going out in the
evening with a boy escort! Ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I <span class='it'>am</span>,” went on Dotty, decidedly. “Dolly’s
going with Tod, and I’m going with Tad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Dolly’s mother say she might?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. But we’re going. And I want a new
red chiffon to wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red chiffon! You’d look fine in red chiffon at
your age! Now, be sensible, Dotty, if you go to that
dance, you must let your father take you, and you
must wear one of your white summer dresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mother, all the girls are going to have new
dresses. Celia Ferris is going to have a white
satin—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A white satin! for a High School girl! How
absurd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t want white satin, but I <span class='it'>do</span> want a
new dress. Can’t I have it, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Dotty, don’t tease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Father, can’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, <span class='it'>I</span> should think you might. You’re a nice
little girl. But, of course, it must be as mother
says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, yes, Mother, do say yes. Won’t you,
Mother? <span class='it'>Won’t</span> you? Aunt Clara, you <span class='it'>beg</span> her to,
won’t you? <span class='it'>Won’t</span> you, Aunt Clara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, child, stop teasing,” and Mr.
Rose glowered at Dotty so very fiercely, that she
knew he was not in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop teasing, Dotty,” said Genie, her little sister.
“You know very well that teasing won’t get
what you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Genie looked so comical, as she shook her fat little
forefinger at Dotty, that they all laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cry, that’s the bestest way,” Genie went on.
“If you cry hard enough, you’re sure to get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right for little kiddies like you, Gene,
but big girls don’t cry. They just say what they
want, and then if their parents are nice, loving, affectionate,
good-hearted people, I should think they
would get their wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well put, Dottikins,” cried her father. “I
guess, Mother, the little girl will have to have her
new furbelows. Of course, you’ll get something suitable.
Say, a nice blue gingham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty smiled absently at this mild jest, and went
on, her first point gained, to her second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I want to go with Tad. I don’t want to
go with father, like a baby. All the girls are going
with the boys. Celia Ferris is going with Lollie
Henry—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That question must wait, Dorothy,” and when
Mrs. Rose used that name, Dotty knew she was very
much in earnest. “I’m comparatively new in Berwick,
and I must find out what the other mothers
think about it before I decide. Now, stop teasing;
after I confer with some of the ladies I’ll decide.
I don’t think much of Celia Ferris as a model. And
I’m by no means sure Dolly’s mother will let her go
with Tod. So you must wait and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty knew from her mother’s manner there was
no use teasing any more, so she turned her attention
back to her frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if it can’t be red chiffon, Mother, can’t it
be red organdie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about it. If you’re so bent on a red
dress, perhaps we can hunt one up.” Mrs. Fayre
smiled at her impetuous daughter, and Dotty felt
sure she had secured a red gown, at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two neighbouring mothers talked matters
over, and it was finally decided that the girls should
not be allowed to go to the party with the boys this
time, but perhaps they might later in the season.
For the dances were occasional, and sometimes there
were three or four during the winter. It was arranged
that Mr. Fayre should take the two D’s
and that Mr. Rose should go to bring them home,
after the dance was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But new dresses were allowed, and Dotty’s of red
organdie, and Dolly’s of white organdie and blue
ribbons, were both pretty and appropriate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had new party cloaks, too, the first they
had ever owned, and it made them feel exceedingly
grown-up to have them flung round their shoulders.
Dolly’s was of light blue cashmere, edged with swansdown,
and Dotty’s was of scarlet cloth, bordered
with a quilling of black satin. Hats were out of
the question, and Mrs. Fayre presented each of the
girls with a little lace scarf to wear on her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very pretty they looked, as, all equipped at last,
they got into the Fayre car, and rolled away. Mr.
Fayre gave them alternately, compliments on their
appearance and advice as to how to behave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dads,” said Dolly, laughing, “any one
would think we had never been out before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you haven’t; that is, to a real evening
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we went to a dance down at Surfwood,
it can’t be so very different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” rejoined Mr. Fayre, and
then they were at the School.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance was held in the big Assembly Room,
and the Committee had decorated it with flowers and
palms, so that it had a gala air indeed. The girls
went to the cloak room, and as they emerged, the
Brown twins met them. Such dressy Brown twins!
And indeed, everybody looked different from the
schoolmates they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” said Tad; “come on, you’re late. The
girls are getting their cards all filled up. Here are
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two D’s took their Dance Programmes a little
shyly. They had never had them before, for this
was their first real Dance Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’pose nobody asks me to dance!” said Dotty,
in a sudden fit of shyness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nonsense!” cried Dolly, “everybody’ll ask
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should worry!” exclaimed Tad, looking at
his pretty partner with an appreciative eye. “Here,
give me both your cards. I want a lot of dances
that I can manage. I’m not much on the fancy
steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the cards and began scribbling his initials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” said Dotty, laughing; “you’re taking
too many, Tad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ho! and you were so ’fraid nobody’d ask
you! You’re a sly-boots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I want a few left, if anybody <span class='it'>should</span> ask,”
and even as she spoke, several of the boys came
clustering round her and Dolly, and very soon their
cards were well filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fun began. The two D’s were both
good dancers, and as nearly all the young people
went to the Berwick Dancing School, they had plenty
of good partners. After each dance they walked
about the room or sat and chatted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Dolly’s surprise there were a great many
strangers present. For, contrary to the ideas of
the elder Fayres and Roses, nearly all the girls did
come with boy escorts, and as many girls were not
invited by the schoolboys, they asked friends from
out of town. There were also girl guests from neighbouring
cities, and altogether, the affair was quite
large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Celia Ferris had her white satin, but it was veiled
with soft white tulle, and made a very pretty, girlish
dance-frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Celia was chummy with the two D’s, but she had
begun to feel a little jealous of them, for they were
exceedingly popular, and received a great deal of
attention. However, she was pleasant-mannered,
and spoke cordially with them whenever they met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time Dolly noticed a girl, who seemed
to be a wall-flower. She was a nice-looking and
well-dressed girl, but she danced very seldom, and
most of the time sat discontentedly looking at the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some other wall-flowers, as is always
the case, but none were so frequently left partnerless
as this particular girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she?” asked Dolly of Lollie Henry, with
whom she happened to be dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s Bernice Forbes. She’s a muff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be rude, Lollie. What do you mean,—a
muff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, only she hasn’t any <span class='it'>go</span> to her,—any
life, any vim, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she might, if she were asked to dance oftener.
Have you asked her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much! I don’t dance with B. Forbes, when
I can get anybody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t very nice of you,” and Dolly looked
reproachfully at her partner. “Won’t you ask her
once, just to please me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d do a lot to please you, sister, but B. F. is a
little too much. Hello, they’re going to supper.
Who’d you come with? Tad or Tod?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m supposed to have come with Tod. But
really my father brought me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. It’s all the same. The Brownies
picked you up after you got there,—you and Dot.
And here comes Tod after you, I must fly to seek
my own special.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lollie went off, and Tod escorted Dolly to the
supper room. The feast was not grand, as High
School affairs are limited, but everybody enjoyed
it. The D’s and the Browns found a place in a pleasant
alcove, and were joined by Celia Ferris and the
Rawlins girls and a lot more of their particular
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly noticed Bernice Forbes, sitting apart from
the rest. With her was a boy Dolly did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?” she whispered to Joe Collins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. Some chap the Forbes girl brought. Of
course no Berwick boy would ask her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick. Can’t say boo to a goose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the reason the Berwick boys don’t want
to talk to her?” asked Dolly mischievously, and Joe
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honest, Dolly, she’s fearful. Just a lump, you
know. But don’t you know her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never did till I went to High. She was at another
Grammar School from the one I went to. She
dresses well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to. Her father is the richest man in
Berwick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is she the daughter of Mr. Forbes, the railroad
man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sure is. Now do you know her better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so! Why, my father is in one of
the offices of Mr. Forbes’ company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? Well, steer clear of the fair Bernice,
believe me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the sandwiches and ice cream and cakes
arrived, and the healthy young appetites did full
justice to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us all about your new house, Dotty,” somebody
was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tisn’t mine any more than Dolly Fayre’s. It
belongs to us jointly and severally, as my father
says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will it be finished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a couple of weeks now, I guess. We’re going
to have a Hallowe’en party to open it. I hope
you’ll all come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the invitation?” said Clayton Rawlins;
“if so, I accept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, this isn’t the regular invitation. That
will come later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have a very big party,” said Celia.
“The house won’t hold very many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a mixed-around party,” explained
Dolly. “Some of it will be in our two own
houses and some in Treasure House.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that what you call it? How pretty,” and
Grace Rawlins smiled at Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Treasure House, because it’s our treasure
and because we’re going to keep our treasures in it.
Oh, it’s going to be the greatest fun! You must all
come over and see it. Don’t wait for Hallowe’en.
Come any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper there were a few more dances before
going home time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With some interest, Dolly watched the Forbes girl.
She danced a few times with the boy with her and
the rest of the time she sat alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reggie Stuart came to Dolly for a dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Reg,” she said, “won’t you let me off of
this, and go and dance it with Bernice Forbes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Will</span> I! Not! What’s the matter, don’t you
want to dance with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. It isn’t that, but—but she
looks lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work! She ought to look lonely. It’s
her own fault, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her own fault, how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she doesn’t try to be gay and perky and
smiley and laughy,—like,—well, like you are. But
if you don’t want me for a partner—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ridiculous, Reg! Of course I do. Come
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They danced away, and for that night at least,
Dolly gave up trying to get the boys to dance with
Bernice. Reginald was not the first one she had
asked, nor the second; but one and all they had refused.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TREASURE HOUSE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>At</span> last the day came when Treasure House was
finished. Painted, papered, furnished, it now lacked
only the finishing touches that the eager hands of
the Two D’s were ready to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Saturday was to be devoted to this fascinating
work, and bright and early, Dotty and Dolly were
signalling each other from their bedroom windows
that the time had arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather slim and very hurried were their breakfasts,
and very abstracted and absentminded their
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dot,” said Mr. Rose, “do have a little scrap
more of this nice bacon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty looked at her father, unseeing, and letting
her gaze rove to her mother, she said, “Which centrepiece
would you put on the table first, Aunt Clara’s
or the one Trudy made?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use mine first,” spoke up Aunt Clara, “for
Trudy’s is much handsomer, and you’d better keep
it for a party occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” and Dotty nodded her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Mr. Rose had sat patiently, serving
fork and spoon held over the dish of curly, crisp
bacon and golden eggs. “I asked you a question,
Dotty,” he said, in an injured tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Dotty gave him that blank stare. “And,
Mother,” she went on, “if you’d just as lieve we’d
have that blue Japanese table mat, for the Study
table, I’ll take it over with me. When I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy Rose,” said her father, with mock severity,
“<span class='it'>am</span> I to hold this fork all day? Will you,
or will you <span class='it'>not</span>, have some bacon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Have what? Oh, Daddy, <span class='it'>did</span> you
bring the screw hooks home last night? You didn’t
forget to get them, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bacon! Bacon! <span class='it'>Bacon!</span>” shouted Mr. Rose.
“I said bacon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the doormat,—you promised to order the
doormat, Father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bacon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire sets came—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bacon!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how you made me jump! No, I don’t want
any bacon, I had some—I think. Anyway, I’m
through breakfast, aren’t you, Dad? Do hurry
up. I want you to go over with me—oh, there’s
Doll!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly came in, her arms full of things for the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want to go in without you, Dot,” she
said. “Goodness, aren’t you through breakfast
yet? I couldn’t eat a thing, hardly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down here, and have some bacon, Dolly,”
said Mr. Rose, hospitably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad, if you say bacon again, I’ll just perfectly
fly! Dolly doesn’t want any, do you, Doll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ’course not! I mean no, thank you, Mr.
Rose. Oh, we can’t wait another minute. Come on,
Dot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty grabbed up some things she had ready to
take, and the two flew out of the side door and over
to Treasure House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a gorgeous morning in late October, and
as the house faced the south, the sun was already
flooding the front piazza of their new domain. Each
girl had a key, and as they went up the steps, Dolly
began hunting in her coat pocket for hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Slowy!” cried Dotty, and, her own key already
in her hand, she snapped it into the lock, and
threw open the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you walk into my parlour, said the flyder to
the spy!” and with a flourish she stood aside for
Dolly to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we must go in together. Why, Dot, this
first entrance ought to be a rite, a—a ceremonial,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ceremonial, your grandmother! Come on in!”
and grabbing Dolly’s arm, the two bounced in, spilling
their parcels, and laughing so hard that there was
small suggestion of ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell breathless, in the two easy chairs that
stood either side of the fireplace, and just grinned
at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day’s come!” exclaimed Dotty; “we’re
really here! Oh, Doll, can you believe it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I simpully <span class='it'>can’t</span>! It’s too good to be true!
Now, shall we light a fire, or fix things up first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far have you progressed?” asked a voice
at the door, and Mr. Rose came in, smiling. “Want
any help? I’ve half an hour to spare. Can I start
a fire for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do, Dad! And show us just how, and then
we can do it ourselves after this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh,” said Dolly, “I know how to make a fire,—I
learned long ago. But it would be better to have
Mr. Rose make the first one, and see if the chimney
draws all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked up the flue with the air of a connoisseur
on fireplaces, and Mr. Rose laughed good naturedly
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The secret of a successful fire is plenty of paper
and kindling-wood,” he said, as he twisted newspapers
into hard rolls. Then he added light sticks and
finally good-sized logs, and declared the fire was
laid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the lighting of this, your first hearth fire,
should be a ceremony,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Dotty, I told you we ought to have a
ceremony! Which of us will light it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both together, of course. Give us each a match,
Dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rose gave each of the girls a match, and as
they were about to strike them, he showed them where
to touch the protruding ends of paper, which he had
purposely arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he said, “One, Two, Three, <span class='it'>Go</span>! May
joy attend all who surround the Hearthstone fires of
Treasure House!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matches blazed, caught the paper, ignited
the kindling, and flames shot up with a glow and a
crackle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an exciting moment for the two girls. They
fell into each other’s arms, and while Dotty was shouting
“Hooray!” at the top of her lungs, the tears
were rolling down Dolly’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You Goosie!” cried Dotty. “What under the
sun are you crying about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause I’m so happy. And anyway, it’s my own
house, I’ve got a right to cry in it, if I want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was smiling now, the tense moment had
passed, and together they danced wildly round the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to be going,” said Mr. Rose, looking at
his watch, “you two Apache Indians had better calm
down and get to work. There’s a lot to be done, I’m
thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ve got all our lives to do it in,” said Dolly,
laughing. “There’s no hurry, and I must get my
eyes used to it a little first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rose went off, and the two girls stood looking
about, as if they never could look enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is what they saw. The Study, flooded
with the Autumn sunlight, and bright with the blazing
fire. Walls hung with plain paper of a lovely greyish
green, with a bordering frieze of foliage in darker
shades. Windows curtained with green silk over lace
bordered scrim. Two wide window-seats, at opposite
sides of the room, cushioned in green, and provided
with many soft, ample-sized green cushions. The
woodwork was white, the low bookshelves were white,
and the furniture was Mission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two desks had arrived, and were placed at the
two ends of the room. Theoretically, the whole room
was divided in halves, Dolly owning the side toward
her home, and Dotty the side toward hers. Under the
window seats were little cupboards for school books,
and besides, there was a roomy coat-closet for each,
with shelves and hooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big table in the middle of the room held an electrolier,
and each girl was to fill her side of the table
with such books or bric-à-brac as she saw fit. Altogether,
it was the cosiest, homiest, dearest room a
girl ever had to study or play in, and it thoroughly
satisfied the Two D’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let’s gaze on the dining-room,” said Dolly.
“I haven’t seen it since last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arms round each other, they went to the next
room. That, of course, was a north room, and so it
had been furnished in yellow. The yellow wallpaper,
with a border of daffodils, was like sunshine, and the
chairs and table were of yellow painted wood. The
curtains were of thin yellow silk, and the glass door
of the cupboard showed a set of yellow china. A big
yellow bowl, of Chinese ware, had been Mrs. Fayre’s
especial gift; though the parents and relatives had all
contributed generously to the furnishings. Bob and
Bert had sent gifts; one a clock and one a picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their pictures were few, as yet, for the girls didn’t
want the discarded ones in their home attics, and preferred
to wait till time should bring some good ones
as Christmas or birthday gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” said Dolly, as they talked this over,
“we don’t want to get it all finished at once, or
we’ll have nothing to look forward to. Let’s do it
slowly, by degrees, and get first, just what we have
to have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Dotty, “only I’m so impatient, I
can’t wait to do things slowly. I wish I could just
wave my hand, and everything would be finished!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goosie! Well, let’s go to work, and do up what’s
to be done right now. Mother’s coming over pretty
soon, and I want her to see it looking nice. I’ll make
the dining-room fire,—or don’t we need one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, Doll. We’ll be flying round, working,
and that will keep us warm. Let’s not light it till
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Come on and gaze at the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kitchenette was a dream in shining nickel and
white enamel. Mr. Fayre was a busy man, and
hadn’t the time to devote to the children that Mr.
Rose could command, so he had insisted on making up
by putting in the entire electrical outfit. There was
provision for cooking, toasting, coffee-making, candy-making,
and some contraptions of which the girls did
not yet know the use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small, but complete kitchen cabinet contained
everything the most fastidious housekeeper could desire,
and a wall cupboard held a supply of neatly
hemmed dish towels, dusters and such matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it great!” exclaimed Dolly. “That white
enamelled sink is dainty enough for a fairy’s bath!
And do observe this corn-popper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this glass lemon-squeezer! Let’s make some
lemonade now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not now! It’s just after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s eleven o’clock, just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is! Whew! we must fly round. Don’t talk
about lemonade, Dot; let’s put our books on their
shelves, and fix the mantel and table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, say we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A basket of trinkets from each house stood waiting,
and the two unpacked and placed their treasures.
Such absorbing work as it was! No very valuable
things had been brought, lest light-fingered gentry
should prowl round some dark night, but lots of
pretty things were available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course we divide the mantel, same’s everything
else,” observed Dolly, as she came, with a tiny ivory
elephant and a larger teakwood one. “Let’s put
Bert’s clock in the middle, and then each fix our own
half. I’ve just got to have my two dearie efelunts
here, and the brass candlestick Grandma gave me.
There, I think that’s enough for my end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks awful skinny. I’ve a lot of stuff for my
half. See; this pair of vases, and this plaster cast
of Dante, and this big white china cat, and this inkstand—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dot, don’t put an inkstand up there! Put
that on your desk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t a using inkstand. It’s just a show
one. Aunt Clara gave it to me last Christmas. See,
it’s iridescent glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is, but it looks like fury up there, and
your end is too crowded, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, I think yours is too skimpy. Looks awful
vacant, with nothing but two elephants and a candlestick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s right not to have such a lot of dinky
doodaddles all over the place. Your end looks like
a junk shop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, imperturbably, Dotty added a big, pink-lined
conch shell and a fussy beribboned calendar. “I like
what I like, Dolly Fayre, and I’ve as much right to fill
up my space as you have to waste yours. You might
rent out a few square feet to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Deed I won’t! Dot, that bunch of rubbish is
fierce! All the girls will laugh at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let ’em, I don’t care. I’ve had that shell ever
since I was a tiny mite. It’s my oldest treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your old-fashionedest, you mean. Say, Dot,
weed out half of those frights, and I’ll give you one
of my candlesticks. They’d look fine at each end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No-sir-ee! I insist on my rights, my whole
rights and nothing but my rights! E pluribus unum,
Erin go bragh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty executed a species of war dance, and shook
her fist defiantly at Dolly, who was standing off, admiring
her end of the mantel and making wry faces
at Dotty’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Dolly broke into laughter. “We’ll have
these scraps all the time, Dot, so I s’pose we may as
well make up our minds to let each other do as we
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like your grammar, and I agree to your dic—dic—what
do you call it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dictum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dictum. Only you needn’t try to dictum
<span class='it'>me</span>! We’re joint monarchs of all we survey, and we
must let each other survey in our own way. I think
my mantel layout is pretty fine. If you don’t I can’t
help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” sighed Dolly, “and you can’t help having
awful taste in decoration, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taste is a matter of opinion, and I opine that
my mantel looks as good as yours, only different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then both girls grinned at each other, and
the peace was unbroken. But the mantel did look
funny!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for our books. Thank goodness, we haven’t
got to share our bookshelves, and we can fix the
things as we like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did on the mantel,” said Dolly, laughing.
“Well, my nonsense books go above, and my girls’
books below. ‘Alice’ first; then ‘Lear,’ and then
the ‘Just so Stories.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, I’m doing mine different. I’m
putting my highbrow books up top. Shakespeare
first, and then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say Milton! You know you’ll <span class='it'>never</span> read
those things out here, or anywhere, except when you
have to write themes on them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But amn’t I going to write themes out here?
What are our desks for, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose so. Oh, well, fix your books as
you like; you will anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='brow'></a></p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“I’m putting my highbrow books up top”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I will. And I hereby give you permission
to do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, oh, <span class='it'>thank</span> you! It’s tiresome work,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jiminy! I should say it was! Come on, Doll,
let’s make some lemonade. I’m choked with dust and
with some old dry lingo that leaked out of my wise
books. Come on, Dollums.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Got any lemons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep, brought some on purpose. Sugar too.
And we can make it in that darling kitchenettio!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away the girls went, and concocted lemonade that
tasted like fairy nectar. To squeeze lemons by
means of their own glass squeezer, to get sugar out of
their own sugar-box (after they had put it in), to
draw water from their own flashing, shining, silver-plated
faucets,—this was joy indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me I never tasted anything so good,”
said Dolly, gazing into her glass, as they sat at their
golden dining-room table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I. But it makes me so fearfully hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At one we must go home to lunch, I s’pose.
Wish we could lunch here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will next Saturday, but of course, we’ve got
to get a lot of things together to do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nearly one, now. We must finish up this
lemonade and scoot. Will you come back right after
your lunch is over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. Quick as I can hop here. But
I’m so hungry I ’spect I’ll eat a whole lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SUCH A LUNCHEON!</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> lemonade finished, and the glasses washed and
put away, the girls were about to start for home,
when along came Trudy and Norah, the Fayres’ cook,
each with a tray covered with a big, white napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goody, <span class='it'>goody</span>, GOODY!” shouted Dotty,
catching sight of them first. “It’s lunch to eat over
here! It is! It <span class='it'>is</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They flung open the front door and as they did so,
there appeared from the house on the other side,
Aunt Clara and Maria, the Roses’ old coloured cook,
one carrying a basket, and the other a strange-looking
burden, muffled up in a piece of blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glory be! but dis yer am hot!” and Maria hurried
in with the blanketed bundle, which proved to be
a silver pot of cocoa, steaming and fragrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughing with glee, the girls relieved the messengers
of their loads and put them all on the dining-room
table. The callers declined to stay, having a
feeling that half the fun of Treasure House was
in the Two D’s having it to themselves. So away
they went, and with shrieks of delight, the donations
were opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you <span class='it'>ever</span> see such a picture!” cried Dolly,
as she brought to view a small platter of cold tongue,
garnished round with asparagus tips and tiny pickles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And gaze on this to go with it!” Dotty said,
flourishing a plate of sandwiches, delicate and dainty,
and of several varieties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s eat ’em now, while the cocoa’s hot, and anyway,
I can’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty seated herself at the table, while Dolly, in
her methodical way, went on with the preparations.
“I’ll put the dessert on this side table,” she said.
“Don’t begin, Dot, till it’s all ready. <span class='it'>Will</span> you
look! Here’s a Floating Island! Just enough for
us two, in Trudy’s best glass dish! And Maria’s
little raisin cakes! Say, Dot, they telephoned or
something and arranged this lunch between the two
houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course they did. <span class='it'>Do</span> come on, Dolly. Don’t
stand admiring the things all day. Come on and
eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, everything is all ready now, and we
can eat in comfort. Here’s a lovely basket of fruit,
but we won’t want that for lunch, let’s keep it for this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it for Christmas! if you’ll only come on!
Dolly Fayre, you are so slow, you do exasperate me
somethin’ awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dotty Rose, you are so impatient, you drive me
crazy!” but Dolly came, smiling and tranquil, and
took her seat at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it great!” she said, looking about at the
pretty golden room, the tempting feast, daintily set
forth, and at eager Dotty, her dark eyes sparkling,
and her red lips pouting at Dolly’s delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simpully gorgeous!” and Dotty’s pout disappeared
as they began the first meal in Treasure
House. “I say, Dollum, isn’t it funny how we Roses
came here and happened to live alongside of you
Fayres, and you and I became such chums?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awful funny. And we’re such good friends,
even though we’re so different in every way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in every way, we like the same things often,
but sometimes we’re so very different, it makes us
seem differenter than we really are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I guess that’s it, though I can’t exactly follow
your meaning. My, but these sandwiches are
good! Let’s have lunch here every Saturday, shall
us? Of course, we’ll fix the things ourselves. We
couldn’t expect Trudy and your Aunt Clara to do
it,—only this first time. But Norah and Maria will
make things for us, and we can do a lot ourselves. I
mean to learn to cook,—not so much cook on the
stove, you know,—as to make sandwiches and salads
and desserts and deviled eggs and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And cocoa—and oh, Dollyrinda, some Saturday
we’ll ask somebody to lunch, and we’ll make all the
things ourselves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, oh, Dotsie, when the boys come home for
Thanksgiving, maybe we won’t have fun! Brother
Bert is crazy to see this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Bob is, too. I expect those two brothers of
ours will just take possession of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Deed they won’t! But of course they can come
here all they want, and if they want to borrow it for
a boy racket of their own, why of course we’ll let
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, isn’t that pretty much taking possession,
I’d like to know! Have some more cocoa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t say, ‘Have some <span class='it'>more</span>’ anything.
You ought to say, ‘Have some cocoa?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve already had some!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it. But that’s good manners. You must
ignore the fact of my having had any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! Well, Miss Fayre, as you haven’t had
any cocoa, to my knowledge, mayn’t I beg you to try
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you put it so politely, I don’t care if I
do take another cup or two. You see, <span class='it'>I</span> don’t have
to ignore it, I own right up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and your manners are too much for
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, honestly, Dotty, it is right not to put in the
‘more.’ And you mustn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I won’t. But it’s simply impossible
for me to ignore the dozens of sandwiches you’ve
eaten. So I’ll say, Have some cake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the sandwiches are all gone, I believe I will
begin on the cake. But, somehow, I don’t feel as
hungry as I did. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nixy. Say, Doll, here’s an idea! S’pose we
save these cakes,—there’s a lot of them,—and that
big basket of fruit till this afternoon and invite the
two Rawlins girls over. How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll go you. For, honest, I can’t eat
any of it now. But we’ll eat up Trudy’s Floating
Island, she makes it lovely, and there isn’t such a lot
of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. If we’re going to ask those girls, we
must get a move on and do up these dishes. I hate
to do dishes, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, at home. But it isn’t so bad here. It’s
kind of fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very much fun. But anyway, the dishes
that belong over to our homes, we can pile in this
basket, and Maria will come for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got to be washed first, though. It isn’t
nice to send them back unwashed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a prim old maid! You ought to live
alone with a cat and a poll parrot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t old-maidness, that’s just plain, every-day
tidiness. Now you get a dish towel, and I’ll
wash, and we’ll have these things put to rights in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls knew how, and they did their work well,
but it did take some time, for such work cannot be
done too swiftly. But on the whole, they enjoyed the
task, and were gratified at the sight of the shining
glass and china in their own glass-cupboard, and
the neatly packed basket and tray full of dishes to
be returned to their home pantries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they went and sat before their Study fire, to
rest and talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” said Dolly, “time does go awful
fast. Here it’s after three o’clock, and the afternoon
is ’most gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we must go home and dress,” said Dotty,
“if we’re going to have Grace and Ethel. These
ginghams won’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not in our pretty new house! Well, let’s go
home and dress, and then we can telephone them,
from home. Shall I do it, or you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll do it. You’ll have all you can do to get
dressed in time to get back here before dark. You’re
so everlasting slow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slow and sure, as the molasses said to the quicksilver.
All right, you telephone the Rawlinses, and
if they can’t come, what then? Shall we ask any one
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might ask Maisie May. But we don’t want a
lot. It’ll seem too much like a party, and besides,
there won’t be enough cakes to go round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. If the Rawlinses can’t come you call
up Maisie, and if she can’t, we’ll flock by ourselves.
Maybe Mother’ll want me to go out with her somewhere,
anyway. You never can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t do that! If you do, I’ll get the girls
to come just to see me. And it would be horrid not
to be together this first day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I ’spect I can come back. Say, Dot, we
ought to have a telephone connection here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish we could, but, you know when we spoke of
it, Dad said we couldn’t have everything all at once.
Let’s strike for it for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But I s’pose we can just as well run
over home to telephone. Now, you take your folkses’
basket and I’ll take our trays. Got your key?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Have you? I’ll lock the door. You go
on. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” and both girls ran away home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Fayre had intended to have Dolly go on an
errand with her, but, hearing of the projected plan,
she let the child off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go over to Treasure House, dear, if you like,”
she said; “but some days I must claim you as my
own little girl. I don’t want to lose you entirely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mumsie,” said Dolly, her arms around her
mother’s neck, “but Saturdays, you know,—can’t I
always have Saturdays for the House?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder. Now go and dress. And
be home by dinner time, Trudy expects company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” and Dolly scampered away to dress.
She heard the telephone and went to answer, thinking
it might be Dotty. And it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rawlins girls are coming,” Dotty said, “and
Maisie happened to be at their house so I had to ask
her too. There’ll be cakes enough if we go light ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’ll be over pretty soon. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly made a leisurely toilette, as she always did.
She rarely moved quickly, but on the other hand, she
was not often late. She put on a pretty little voile
frock, of bluet blue, with white pipings. A big white
ribbon bow tied her hair back, and then it fell in a
long braid, with curly ends. She threw a big cloak
round her, one of Trudy’s discarded party-cloaks,
and ran across to Treasure House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Dotty was already there. She had on a
dress of bright Scotch plaid, which suited her type.
Scarlet ribbons on her hair, and a necklace of bright
red beads made her look quite festive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a jolly cloak! Trude’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was, but she gave it to me. Just the thing
to wear to run over here. It’s warm, but it’s handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dandy, you mean. Wish I had one. I
guess I can bamboozle Mother or Auntie into making
me one. You look awfully nice this afternoon.
Why didn’t you wear your blue beads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t quite match this frock. They’re too
greenishly blue. Why did you wear those red
ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause they <span class='it'>do</span> match this dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they don’t. They’re crimson and the red in
the plaid is scarlet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a fuss! Well, then, I wore ’em ’cause
they’re pretty and becoming and I like ’em,—so
there now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, glad you do. Here come the girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further discussion of tints and shades was cut
short by the entrance of Grace and Ethel Rawlins
and Maisie May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if this isn’t the greatest place! I never
heard of such a thing before. Where did you get the
idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s just heavenly! Such lovely furniture
and things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s another room! Why, a dining-room!
I <span class='it'>never</span> did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exclamations drowned each other. The visitors
went in each of the three rooms and each called forth
new praises. It was indeed a novelty, and appealed
to the girls’ hearts as a most desirable and cosy place
to read or study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>can</span> you study here?” asked Maisie. “I
should think you’d be all the time thinking what to do
next to fix it up, and you couldn’t put your mind on
your lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that way,” laughed Dolly. “We
haven’t really tried it yet. You see we only moved in
this morning. Not everything is to rights yet. We
don’t mind you girls seeing it before it’s all done,
but I want it in apple-pie order before we have the
Hallowe’en party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” said Dotty, “let’s gather round the
Study fire, and talk over the party. Hallowe’en
isn’t so very far away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls drew up chairs for some and cushions
from the window-seats for some, and grouped themselves
comfortably before the fire. Dolly put on a
log from time to time, for she was one of those rare
creatures who are born with a sense of fire-building,
as others are born with a sense of colour or rhythm.
She always knew just where to poke the dying logs,
and where to lay the fresh ones. Dotty had promised
not to touch it, for she had a fatal propensity
for putting the fire out, or at least causing it to die
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s ideal!” exclaimed Grace; “I do envy you
girls this place. I wish we could have one, but
Father wouldn’t hear of it. He’d think it cost too
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It didn’t cost such an awful lot, my father says,”
said Dolly. “But, you know it isn’t always cost
that counts. Lots of things are unusual, and that
makes people think they are impossible. Your
father could afford one, Grace, if he wanted to.
You see, it could be built much cheaper than this
one. You needn’t really have but one room and
then—my goodness! What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a regular hullabaloo was heard outside.
Knocking at the door, tapping at the windows, even
pounding on the house itself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty looked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the boys!” she said, and her voice was as of
one who announces a dire calamity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Dolly. “What
shall we do? I didn’t want them this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell ’em they can’t come in,” said Maisie. “It
isn’t fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Grace. “Just open the door, and
tell them they must wait till next week. I’ll tell
them, if you want me to. My brother Clayton is
there, and I’ll make him take the others away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go to the door,” said Dotty. “I can make
them go away. If Doll goes, she’ll be so good-natured
she’ll let them in. And we haven’t enough—well,
that is,—we don’t want them to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noise continued, and the boys were now peeping
in at the windows, and making signs of impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty and Grace opened the door, intending to
persuade the would-be visitors to depart in peace,
but the boys entered in a sort of flying wedge. It
would have taken far more than two girls to keep
them out. They were by no means rude or boisterous,
but they were so determined to come in,—that
they just came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” shouted Lollie Henry, “if this isn’t a
peach of a place! How do <a id='you'></a>you do, Dolly and Dotty!
I suppose you’re hostesses. Yes, we <span class='it'>will</span> come in,
thank you! De-lighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the other boys,—and there were half a
dozen of them,—joined the acclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looky here at the dining-room! Well, maybe
we aren’t swell! Wowly-wow-wow! See the dinky
little kitchen-place! What do you cook, girls?
Oh, no, thank you, we <span class='it'>can’t</span> stay to supper. Oh, no,
we <span class='it'>really</span> can’t. <span class='it'>So</span> sorry! Still, of course, if you
<span class='it'>insist</span>—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Two D’s gave in. The boys were so honestly
interested and admiring, and they wanted to see
everything so much that the hostesses couldn’t bear
to turn them out, and indeed, they couldn’t turn them
out if they had tried. So they let them stay, ungrudgingly,
and after viewing the whole domain, the
entire company surrounded the Study fire once more.
The boys mostly sat on the floor, but that made it all
the merrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you the honest truth,” said Dolly, a little
later. “We’ve got enough cakes and fruit for one
piece all round, if that will satisfy you, all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ample!” declared Tod Brown. “I <span class='it'>never</span> eat
more than one piece of fruit. A small quarter of
an apple, or a section of an orange is a great sufficiency
for my delicate appetite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others rejoined with similar nonsense, and the
scant refreshments were brought out and divided
fairly, amid much laughter, and generous attempts
at self denial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the opening day at Treasure House passed
off in great glee and merriment, and every guest was
well pleased with the entertainment.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FUNNY UNCLE JIM</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Through</span> the ensuing week the girls used Treasure
House for study hours; and too, they finished up
much in the way of furnishing. They were not both
there every day, and sometimes neither was there, but
the House was a great comfort, and soon they felt
greatly at home in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s getting fitted to us, like a shoe,” declared
Dotty after a few days. “At first, I didn’t like the
feel of this chair. Now, I love it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it funny how you get used to things,” said
Dolly, musingly. “But you can’t always. I’m trying
to get used to Bernice Forbes, and yet somehow,
I can’t like her, and I don’t know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can’t, Dolly. She isn’t our sort.”
And Dotty shook her head as if she had settled the
question for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pshaw! Our sort! What is our sort, I’d
like to know. She’s just as good as we are, just as
rich, just as fashionable—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mean those things. She’s richer
than any of our set, and fashionabler, too. But that
doesn’t make her our sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what does? if you know so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s too stuck-up, for one thing. But that isn’t
the main thing. She’s a—oh, I don’t know how to
express it. But she hasn’t any gumption, or any,—oh,
any sense. But she <span class='it'>thinks</span> she has, and it’s
<span class='it'>that</span> that makes her so disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you’re altogether right, but I’m
going to find out. I don’t see why nobody likes her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you ought to see that if nobody does like
her, it’s because she isn’t likable, for some reason or
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do see that, and I’m going to find out that some
reason or other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitch in, and find out, then. Good luck to you!
Oh, here comes Grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I’d find you here,” said Grace Rawlins,
as Dotty opened the door to her. “Hello, Dolly,
busy studying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just about to begin to think about getting at
it,” returned Dolly, laughing. “But it can wait; sit
down, Gracie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t stay a minute. I just flew in to ask you
two to go nutting to-morrow, up at Uncle Jim’s
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gorgeous! I’d love to go,” cried Dotty and
Dolly echoed, “So would I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s just only us and Ethel and Maisie. I
can’t ask any more, ’cause Uncle is going to send for
us in his car, and he’ll send us home again. Won’t
it be fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! I can do all my lessons to-night, can’t
you, Doll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, whether I can or not. What time do we
start, Grace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One o’clock, sharp. Be ready, won’t you?
And don’t wear too good clothes, it’s a real country
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, we’ll wear our oldest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace went away, declaring she wouldn’t longer
interfere with their study, and the Two D’s set to
work in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we can’t have lunch over here to-morrow,”
Dotty said, a bit regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, there are lots of other Saturdays.
I’d rather go nutting while we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I. Now keep still, I’ve got to attack
these Geometry problems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank goodness, I’ve done mine. But History
still stares me in the face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence settled down upon them, broken occasionally
by a murmur of this sort: “Ptolemy I was
followed by a series of monarchs—by a series
of monarchs—what are you going to wear, Dotsie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old brown gingham—the cube root of
xy—364/2—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly burst into laughter. “X square plus seven
X plus fifty-three equals eleven thirds!” she quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty laughed back and quoted their favourite
“Hunting of the Snark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must be what, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly and perfectly true,” said Dolly, who
was only half listening, but who knew her Lewis
Carroll by heart. Her eyes were turned up to the
ceiling and she was gabbling over and over—“by
a series of monarchs also called Ptolemies down to
the time of Queen Cleopatra, the last of the line. By
a series of Ptolemies—a series of Ptolemies also
called monarchs,—h’m—also called Cleopatra—no,
also called—also called—oh, what <span class='it'>were</span> the old
things called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re nutty!” said Dotty. “No, my child,
that isn’t slang, I mean you’re thinking of the nutting
party and you can’t get the series of mummies
straight in your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They weren’t mummies—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were after they stopped being monarchs,
weren’t they? All Egyptians were,—I mean, all
fashionable Egyptians. Do keep still, dear, sweet
Dollyrinda, <span class='it'>do</span> keep still. The cube root of xy,—<span class='it'>Oh!</span>—I
do abhor, detest, despise, abominate these
cubed XY’s!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But having thus exploded her wrath, Dotty set to
work in earnest and finally conquered the refractory
factors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done!” she announced, at the end of a half hour
of hard work. “I’ve cubed everything in sight, and
some roots that were hidden deeply and darkly in the
earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to be a Cubist, that we read so much
about in the papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you. I’ll cube what I have to, but I’ll
never go out cubing, for pleasure. How are your
Ptolemies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully mixed up. I’m going to let them simmer
over night, and get up early and attack them
with the dew on them. Perhaps I can lash ’em to the
mast then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day turned out to be an ideal piece of
weather. Clear, cold, the wind tossing white drifts
of cloud about in the upper blue, and descending to
whisk the nuts off the trees for those who desired
them. The wind was aided and abetted by Uncle
Jim’s men, and when the crowd of girls arrived, there
was a widespread area of nut-besprinkled ground
awaiting them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is some sort of a nutting party,” said
Dolly, as, each with a basket, they started to the
fray. “All I’ve been on lately, meant hunting
around half an hour for three small nuts,—one
wormy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly, what a sad experience,” Grace returned.
“I’m so glad I brought you up here to
Brazil, where the nuts come from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s sure some little old Brazil, all right,” agreed
Dotty, and then they all stooped to their task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baskets were quickly filled, and the girls sat down
to rest under a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This must be the old original spreading Chestnut
Tree,” said Maisie. “I always wondered if it did
really spread such a lot. I see it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the spread!” said Grace, as a maid
appeared bearing a tray filled with glasses and plates.
The contents were sweet cider and ginger cakes, and
to the hungry girls they looked very good indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must be getting home,” said Ethel. “I
promised Mother we’d be back by five or six, at
latest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t go till Uncle Jim sends us,” said Grace.
“I told him we wanted to leave at four, but he only
said ‘Oh, shucks!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” asked Dolly. “And isn’t there
any Aunt Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he’s a bachelor. Lives here alone, except for
the servants. The truth is, he’s a little shy before a
lot of strange girls. Guess I’ll go and hunt him
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran away to the house, and Ethel explained
further: “You see, he’s Mother’s uncle. Quite an
old man. And old-fashioned in his ways, except that
he has a motor-car and a telephone. But personally,
he’s as backwoodsy as Methuselah; but a dear old
thing, and awfully kind-hearted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace came back in triumph, leading Uncle Jim.
Pushing and pulling him, rather, for the old man was
clearly unwilling to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Pussy, whatyer want to drag an old
man like me out here fur? These city young misses
don’t wanter see me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we do, Uncle Jim,” called out Ethel, and
they all echoed, “Yes, we do, Uncle Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, what a perty lot o’ young misses.
And have you all got all the nuts you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeedy!” cried Dolly. “All we can carry,
and more too. And we’re ever and ever so much
obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, not at all! Ye’re welcome to all and
more. It’s a sight to see young things runnin’
around the old place. Why don’t ye bring ’em up
oftener, Gracie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only waiting for an invitation, sir,” and Dotty’s
sparkling black eyes laughed into the old face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shucks, now! Well, I hereby invite ye, one and
all, to come up here jest whenever ye like, and raise
hob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Maisie. “I just love to raise
hob! Let’s come next week, girls, when those other
nuts are ripe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, now jest <span class='it'>do</span>!” said the old man, delightedly.
“This old place don’t get sight of chick nor child
very often. Must ye be goin’ now? Well, mind
now, ye’re to come agin next week. Make a day of
it, and bring more of yer young friends. I’ll see to
it that Sary makes ye some good old-fashioned doughnuts,
and apple turnovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Uncle Jim, I’ve an idea,” and Ethel
ran to him and laid her hand impressively on his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fer the land’s sake, Ethel, ye don’t say so!”
and Uncle Jim shook with laughter at his own wit.
“A little gell like you with an idea! Sho, sho, now.
Come, out with it! It might fester!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you tease me. But it’s just this.
S’pose we come up here on Hallowe’en and have a
witch party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My patience! what an idea for a little gell to
have! Now, lemme see,—lemme see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that’s too much trouble for you, Uncle Jim,”
said Grace. “You oughtn’t to have proposed it,
Ethel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, now, wait a minnit, Gracie. Don’t you be
too hasty. ’Tain’t no trouble at all, I wasn’t thinkin’
of that. I was thinkin’ if I could make things nice
and perty fer you young misses. That’s the trouble.
I’m plain, you see, plain, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that’s just what we want, Uncle Jim, just
the plain house, and orchard. We’ll do all the fixing
up, ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, wait a minnit, I tell you. Don’t go
so everlastin’ fast. I can’t keep up with you.
Here’s the trick. You have your mother come up in
the arternoon, and she can help me put things a leetle
mite to rights. Then me and Sary and Etty can do
the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother’ll be glad to come. How about it,
girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we were going to have a Hallowe’en party,
ourselves,” said Dotty, smiling as she saw Dolly’s
look of consternation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it; but don’t you think this would be
more fun, in the country, you know. Don’t you,
Dolly? We won’t do it, if you say not,” and Grace
looked embarrassed, “but I thought your party was
more like a house-warming for your new playhouse,
and so—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I say,” and Dotty, turned to Dolly.
“Whatcha think, Dollops? Speak out in meetin’!
If you don’t want to come up here, say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said Dolly, her face clearing. She
couldn’t think as rapidly as Dotty, and it took her
a minute or two to readjust her plans. “It will be
heaps of fun. Are you sure you want us,—Uncle
Jim?” The blue eyes looked up into his own, and
Uncle Jim said heartily, “You bet I do! Every one
here, and a half a dozen more perty young misses,
and then boys enough to go round, can you get that
many?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, we’ll ask all our crowd, and fill up with
some of the others. What fun! I’m sure Mother
will be pleased, she loves to come up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Gracie, girl, you talk it over with her,
and I’ll be down in a few days, and we’ll see about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we go in the house, Uncle, and see how it is
for a party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure and sartain! Go right along, the hull
pack o’ ye. Browse around, and see the hull shack,
and by then, I’ll be ready to send ye home. Go right
in the kitchen door. Sary, she’s the cook, ’ll be glad
to see you, and Etty, that’s her darter, ’ll show ye
round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls went to the kitchen door, not quite so
sure of Sary’s warm welcome as their host was. But
they found he was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for the land’s sake! What a delegation!
Come in, Miss Grace and Miss Ethel, and bring
your friends. Excuse my untidiness. I wasn’t no-ways
expecting company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apology was wholly unnecessary, for everything
in Sary’s kitchen was spick and span and shining.
She was a buxom woman of middle age, and
had a broad, smiling face, overflowing with good
nature. Her daughter, Etty, was the one who
brought them their cakes and cider, and she was shy,
but exceedingly curious to see the city ladies,—as
the girls seemed to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She conducted them all over the fine old farmhouse,
and listened in surprise as they exclaimed in wonder
and delight over the big open fireplaces, and old
mahogany furniture, that seemed to her the most uninteresting
and commonplace affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly gorgeous!” cried Dotty. “Oh, Grace,
I’d ever so much rather have the Hallowe’en party
here. Wouldn’t you, old Dollypops?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. And we can just as well have
any other sort of a party at Treasure House.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course we can. And we will. After this affair
is over. I say, girls, let’s have it a masquerade!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let’s!” said Maisie. “I’ve a dress all ready
to wear. It’s a witch dress, all—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we ought all to dress as witches,” interrupted
Grace. “Or spooks or hobgoblins or—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” put in Dotty, “but the boys
won’t do it. They hate dressing up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let ’em stay away, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, a Hallowe’en party without boys is no fun.
They make up the tricks and jokes, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” said Dolly, “but if you tell the boys
they can’t come unless they wear spooky rigs, they’ll
do it fast enough. Why, a sheet and pillowcase
ghost-rig is good enough, and that’s no trouble at
all! Don’t you know Dot, we wore them up at
Crosstrees last summer, and the boys didn’t mind a
bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep, that’s so. Oh, the boys will come. You
couldn’t keep them away. What a fireplace to roast
chestnuts or pop corn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the dining-room now, and its enormous
stone fireplace was indeed ideal for a Hallowe’en
frolic. And the kitchen, too, offered enchanting possibilities.
Then there was the orchard, if any one
dared try fortunes beneath the stars. Altogether it
was a splendid chance and the Two D’s were glad to
lay aside their own half formed plans for these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way home, they talked it over, and as they
drew near the Roses’ house the D’s asked the other
girls to come in and talk some more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Grace, “I promised Mother, Ethel
and I would get home early. It’s a little after five
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you come in, Maisie,” said Dolly. “We’ll
make fudge. You can stay till six, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, and I’m simply starving for fudge.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A STRANGE INTRUDER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>do</span> think this is the dearest place,” said Maisie,
as they went in the door of Treasure House. “I
never heard of such a thing before. Whose plan was
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our two fatherses, mostly,” replied Dotty.
“Wait a minute, girls, till I switch on the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment a small side light pierced the gloom,
but before she could turn on the larger light, Dotty
gave a scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she fairly shrieked, “what is that? who is
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is what?” cried Dolly following her in, and
Maisie came quickly after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they saw what she meant. Somebody or
something lay on the floor. Something like a person,
but still and unmoving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a woman!” screamed Dotty, as she peered
down into a veiled white face. “Oh, who can it be?
How did she get here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always excitable, Dotty was now fairly beside herself
with fear and alarm, and not daring to touch the
prostrate figure, she shuddered and fell back against
the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> can’t look! What is it?” and Dolly clapped
her hands over her eyes, and refused to take them
down. “See what it is, Maisie, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I don’t see why I—I sh-should, when you
and D-D-Dotty won’t,” and Maisie cowered in
another corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly peeped out from between her fingers. Maisie
had fallen in a heap on a window-seat, and was shaking
with nervous fear. Dotty was staring at the
woman on the floor, but was now showing more curiosity
than terror. Dolly glanced at the still form
lying there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she—is she d-dead?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ridiculous!” cried Dotty, “of course not. She—she
just stepped in here, and—and f-fainted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” and Dolly became hysterical. “That’s
like a f-funny story Father tells, ab-bout the man
who called at a house and said, ‘P-please let me have
a f-f-fit in your hall’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he stuttered as much as you do, I guess he had
a chill instead of a fit,” giggled Dotty, and then
Maisie roused herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s lift her up,” she said; “I’m not afraid.
Come and help me.” She took a few steps nearer the
woman, and then catching another look at the face
she cried, “Oh, I can’t! She looks so queer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer, how?” and Dotty’s ever-ready curiosity
overcame her repugnance, and she drew near to look
in the half-hidden face. “If I dared lift her veil—”
she bent over, and drew back instantly. “Oh, girls,
her face is cold, stone cold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she’s dead!” wailed Dotty. “I told you
so! Dead in our pretty house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if the poor lady is dead, she can’t harm us.
Let’s lift her up,” and Maisie, with returning courage,
put her hand under the mop of grey hair, which
was partly hidden beneath a dark felt hat. But
again, the strange, eerie sensation of touching an
inert form overcame her and pulling her hand away,
she ran back to the window-seat. “I can’t! I
thought I could, but I can’t. Oh, what shall we
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’pose we’ll have to go and get somebody,” said
Dolly dolefully. “Shall I go, and you two stay here,
or who—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you go and leave me here alone with
Maisie!” screamed Dotty. “I won’t let you, Dolly.
Maisie, you go and get somebody, and Dolly and I will
stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maisie started, but on opening the door, and peering
out, she flew back, slamming the door hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” cried both girls. “What did you
see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh!” and Maisie shivered and shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us, what’s out there? What did you see
out there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, n-n-othing. But it’s so dark! I’m afraid
to go out. There may be more of them—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More people wanting to have a fit in our hall?”
said Dotty, who never could fail to see the ridiculous
side of anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Dot,” implored Dolly. “<span class='it'>Don’t</span> talk like
that! Maybe she is d-dead, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe? Why, of <span class='it'>course</span> she is! She doesn’t
breathe or move at all. Of course she’s dead, Dolly.
We’ve got to go and get somebody. Suppose we all
go. It’s awful to leave her here alone, but what can
we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we oughtn’t all to leave her. Maybe she’ll
come to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can’t if she’s dead, can she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, wait a minute. You always fly off so quick,
Dotty. Let me think. Let’s all sit down here and
think a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly pulled the two girls down beside her on a
window-seat. They looked at the silent, motionless
form. The woman lay on her side, her hands under
her. Her feet in old buttoned shoes stuck out beneath
a shabby skirt of dark cloth, frayed at the
edges. She wore a big, dark coat of rough cloth.
Her hat was held on by a thick veil through which
they could quite plainly see her face. She had a very
white complexion, but very red cheeks, and staring
wide-open blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her grey hair was frowsy and half tumbling down,
and round her neck was an old black feather boa.
Altogether she looked poorly dressed but her face
gave promise of being pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to see her better,” declared Dotty, as
Dolly’s cogitation had promised no suggestions.
“I’ve just simply <span class='it'>got</span> to! Maisie, will you help lift
her head, if I’ll help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will,” said Maisie, decidedly; “I won’t
flinch this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty went over and knelt at the woman’s side.
Maisie knelt at her head. “Now,” said Dotty, “I’ll
put my hands under her shoulders and you put yours
beneath her head, and we’ll sit her up. Maybe—well,—maybe
she isn’t—you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gently Dotty put her hand under the old cloth
coat, carefully Maisie passed her hand again under
the grey hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” said Dotty, and as they lifted, the grey
hair came off in Maisie’s hand, and—the head of
the woman rolled away from the body! All three
girls shrieked, and then Dotty began to scream with
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she cried. “Oh, that naughty little thing!
Oh, how could she! Girls, girls, it isn’t a woman, it’s
a dummy thing that horrid little Genie fixed up to
tease us! She ought to be punished for this! But
we <span class='it'>were</span> well taken in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other two began to realise at last what Dotty
meant. Sure enough, the grey hair was a wig, or
rather, what is known as a “Transformation.” The
head was a plaster cast, nearly life size, and the body
of the supposed woman was a small bolster dressed
in old clothes. The shoes were merely tucked under
the edge of the skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty lifted up the head and pulled off the veil.
“It’s my old cast of the head of the Milo Venus,”
she said. “See, that little scamp has painted the
cheeks and lips red, and the eyes blue, and left the
rest white. No wonder she looked pale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with that veil on, it sure did look like a person,”
said Maisie. “Well she had the joke on us, all
right! I was scared out of my wits!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So was I,” whispered Dolly, who was still
shaking; “and I can’t get over it. It was awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pooh!” said Dotty, “I was scared too. But
I fully expect to get over it! I think we all will!
Don’t worry, Doll, a pan of fudge will calm your
nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s too late to make fudge. I want to go
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay right where you are, sister. A few more
bright lights, and a fudge-fest will make a new Dolly
of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she talked, Dotty was switching on lights all
over the house, getting out chocolate and the chafing-dish,
and, making signs to Maisie to perk up and be
gay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maisie took the hint, and in a short time, there was
excellent fudge ready for three merrily laughing
girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty felt the responsibility of the thing, for it
was her sister who was the culprit. She recognised
the cast and also the clothing and the wig, and she
knew it could have been no one else but the mischievous
Genie. So she did all she could to remove
the shadow of unpleasantness that hung round the
performance, and she succeeded admirably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, the talk turned to the Hallowe’en
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose Grace and Ethel will make out the list
of invitations,” said Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t take much making out,” was Maisie’s
idea. “They’ll just ask our crowd and that will be
about enough. Us five who were there to-day, and
Celia, and six boys, will be twelve. That’s plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish she’d ask Bernice Forbes,” said Dolly,
doubtfully, “but I s’pose she won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’pose she won’t, too,” said Dot. “Pooh, who
wants Bernice Forbes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, for one,” asserted Maisie. “I can’t
bear the girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why,” argued Dolly. “She would be
all right if people would be nice to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right? She <span class='it'>can’t</span> be all right,” and Dotty
shook her head. “She don’t know <span class='it'>how</span> to be all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” and Maisie laughed. “Well, I must
go home, girls. I’ve had a lovely fudge party, and
I think Genie’s joke was a great success. Tell her
so, for me, Dotty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will,” and with laughing good-byes,
Maisie went home and the Two D’s stayed to put
things straight. It was their rule never to leave
Treasure House untidy over night. Dotty whistled
and Dolly sang, as they flew around and soon had
things ship-shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dot,” said Dolly, as they poked out the
dying embers of the fire, “I want to tell you something.
I’m going to ask Grace to ask Bernice to that
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you’re not, Dollyrinda. You think so now,
but you go home and think it over, and you’ll see that
you’ll spoil the whole party if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean spoil it for <span class='it'>you</span>! It won’t for anybody
else. Not everybody is as mean as you are to
that girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody likes her, you’ve often said so yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more reason, then, to have her there and
let them learn to like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good gracious! you make me tired! Why
are you so everlastingly gone on her? Just because
she’s rich?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dotty Rose, you take that back! That’s a mean
thing to say, and you <span class='it'>know</span> it isn’t true. <span class='it'>Don’t</span>
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never knew you to care for anybody for
that reason before; but I can’t think of any other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that <span class='it'>isn’t</span> the reason, and you know it
perfectly well. Now, I’ll tell you what the reason
is, if you can understand it, and I don’t know as you
can. It’s because I’m sorry for her. Everybody
snubs her, and she’d just love to be liked and sought
after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she <span class='it'>would</span>, would she? Then why doesn’t
she make herself liked and sought after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can she, if we don’t give her a chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her make her own chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, she can’t, Dotty. If no one invites her
anywhere, how can she make herself agreeable and
pleasant to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her give a party herself, and invite us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no doubt she’d be glad to, if she thought we’d
go to it. But if we snub her right and left, she
won’t dare ask us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let her be more pleasant at school, then.
She’s stuck-up and proudy, and she thinks she’s the
whole world. Oh, let up, Dolly! what do you want
to bother with her for? There are enough in our
crowd already. And we just plain don’t want her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dot, you’re horrid. Can’t you feel sorry for
her? Put yourself in her place. How would you
feel if everybody turned the cold shoulder to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be so gay and merry they’d <span class='it'>have</span> to like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all very well, because everybody <span class='it'>does</span>
like you. But if they snubbed you, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dollops, if I deserved it, I’d have to grin
and bear it, I ’spect. But facts is facts. You can’t
make Bernie Forbes over, and unless you can, you
can’t make people like her, and that’s all there is
about it. And another thing, Doll. I know and
you know your high and noble aim in this matter,
but the others don’t, and wouldn’t believe it if they
did. You go on like this, and people will soon be
saying that you’re toadying to Bernice Forbes just
because she’s the richest girl in town. And you’ll see
what they’ll think of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, I don’t care if they do. Bernice hasn’t
any mother, and her father is a stern, grumpy old
thing, and I <span class='it'>am</span> sorry for her, and I <span class='it'>am</span> going to do
anything I can to help her have a good time, and I
<span class='it'>am</span> going to coax Grace Rawlins to ask her to the
Hallowe’en party! So there, now, Miss Dorothy
Rose, you can put that in your pipe and smoke it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dolly was in earnest, she was very much so,
and Dotty well knew there was no use combating her
in this mood. So she changed her tactics, and said,
laughingly, “Well, don’t let <span class='it'>us</span> quarrel about it anyway.
And it’s time to go home now. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t come on, till you say you’ll help me
in my plan. If you and I both ask Grace to ask
Bernie, she’ll do it. But if I ask her, and then you
go to her, and ask her <span class='it'>not</span> to, she <span class='it'>won’t</span> do it. And
I know that’s <span class='it'>just</span> what you’ll do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, that was exactly what Dotty
<span class='it'>had</span> intended to do. In fact, she had already
planned in her quick-working mind, to telephone the
moment she got home, to Grace, and ask her <span class='it'>not</span> to
consent to Dolly’s request. It wasn’t that Dotty
had such rooted objections to Bernice, but she <span class='it'>was</span>
unattractive and stiff, and, moreover, exceedingly
critical. And too, Dotty didn’t care so especially
about the party, but she didn’t want Bernice included
in the six girls who made up “their crowd,” and if
Dolly took her up so desperately, first thing they
knew, she would be in the “crowd” and she would be
all the time coming to Treasure House, and—here
was the rub,—Dotty feared, way down deep in her
inmost heart, that Bernice might cut her out with
Dolly, and that would be the crowning tragedy! It
was scarcely possible, of course, but Dolly took
strange notions sometimes, and Dotty was taking no
chances on such a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll promise not to say anything to
Grace at all, about it. But I won’t promise to coax
her to ask Bernice, for I don’t want her to. Aw,
Dollyrinda, let up on that crazy scheme. It’s only
a whim. And don’t you see, if you get her asked
there, and she <span class='it'>doesn’t</span> have a good time, she’ll wish
she hadn’t come after all. And so you’ll be giving
her a disappointment instead of a pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she would have a good time. I’d see that
she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Yes</span>, you would! And how? Why, you’d ask
the boys to be nice to her, and dance with her and
everything. And—would they do it? They would
<span class='it'>not</span>! <span class='it'>Did</span> they do it, when you asked them at the
High School Dance? They did <span class='it'>not</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lollie told me. He said it was ducky of you to
try to be so nice to her, but it wouldn’t go down.
The boys just simply plain won’t,—and you know
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it mean of them, Dot? Don’t you think it
is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. I keep telling you, Dolly, if
Bernice was nice to people, you wouldn’t have to try
to boost her. And if she isn’t, boosting won’t do any
good. There’s the whole thing in a nutshell. Now
we <span class='it'>must</span> go home, or they’ll be sending over after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose we must. Well, Dot, I’ll see about
this thing. I’ve got to think it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, old slowpoke thinker! And say, Dollops,
you aren’t mad at what Genie did, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goodness no. You know I don’t like practical
jokes much; you know how I hated that one
they played on Miss Partland, but I’m not mad at
Genie, of course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you. But I’ll see that she isn’t allowed
to do such a thing again.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FAIRIES AND SUCH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dolly</span> did think over the question of Bernice Forbes
and the party. And the result of her cogitation led
her straight to Grace’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come,” she said, “to ask a favour, Grace. I
want to know if you won’t ask Bernice Forbes to your
Hallowe’en party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dolly, I would,—only,—well, you see the
number is all made up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What number?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The number I planned to invite. Twelve, it
is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But couldn’t you add two more? Bernice, and
another boy to make it even?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I could, but,—you know, Dolly, nobody
likes Bernice. She’s—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t tell me what she is! I know it! But,
Grace, I think it’s mean, the way we girls treat her.
Now, never mind <span class='it'>what</span> she is, won’t you ask her, just
for my sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s smile was very winning and her blue eyes
very pleading and Grace was about to consent, when
Ethel came in. They told her the subject under discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much!” declared Ethel. “If that thing
goes, <span class='it'>I</span> don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Dolly blazed back, “if she <span class='it'>doesn’t</span> go,
<span class='it'>I</span> don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably neither girl meant what she said, but
having said it, they both stuck to it. So spirited the
argument became, that Mrs. Rawlins overheard the
angry voices and came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>is</span> the matter, girlies? Why, Dolly
Fayre, what are you crying about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not crying, Mrs. Rawlins,” and Dolly
brushed a tear or two off her cheeks, “b-but I’m
afraid,—maybe I m-might. I guess I’ll go home
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till you tell me the trouble, dear,” and Mrs.
Rawlins sat down beside the disturbed guest. “What
is it, Grace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my fault, Mrs. Rawlins,” Dolly spoke up.
“I was trying to make the girls do something they
don’t want to. And I had no business to do it.”
Dolly was always just, even against herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it? Tell me, Ethel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mother, Dolly wants to ask Bernice Forbes
to our party, and we don’t want to, ’cause she’d
spoil the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” and Mrs. Rawlins smiled. “Is Bernice
such a spoilsport as all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, Mrs. Rawlins, she <span class='it'>isn’t</span> awfully
nice, but I’m sorry for her; and I thought if we invited
her to things, and made her like us, she’d be
nicer, and we’d like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the only reason, Dolly?” and Mrs. Rawlins
looked quizzically at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately it came into Dolly’s mind how Dotty
had said everybody would attribute Dolly’s interest
in Bernice to the fact that she was the daughter of
the richest man in town, and really an heiress in
her own right. Dolly blushed uncomfortably, but
she looked straight at her questioner, and replied,
“Yes, Mrs. Rawlins, it’s only because I’m sorry for
Bernice, and,” she hesitated, and then added, honestly,
“and a <span class='it'>little</span>, because everybody is so down
on her, and I don’t think it’s fair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t either!” declared the lady, heartily;
“you’re just right, Dolly. And Bernice shall be
invited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Ethel says she won’t go, then,” began
Grace, as Ethel herself spoke up, “Oh, of course I
will, if mother says we must ask Bernice. I don’t
care such a terrible lot, anyway, and I’m sorry I
was snappy to you, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I was snappy, too,” and Dolly’s pretty
face showed real contrition. “Are you sure you
won’t mind too much, girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they won’t,” Mrs. Rawlins answered
for them. She was a pretty, smiling little lady, and
as a rule everybody who was with her liked to do
as she said. “Now that is settled, Bernice shall be
asked. Mustn’t we then ask one more boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mother, and let’s ask Clayton to get some
one. He knows a lot of boys, and he’ll know just
which one to ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea, Gracie. Is your dress ready, Dolly?
What are you going to wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t tell you that before the girls! You
know it’s a masquerade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, so it is. Well, set your mind at rest,
dear. I’ll ask Bernice myself, and I’ll tell her about
the masquerade. Don’t let any one know she’s coming,
and then they’ll never suspect who she is, until
you take off your masks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a lovely idea, Mrs. Rawlins,” and
Dolly’s eyes shone with pleasure. “Don’t tell, will
you, girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Grace, “but everybody will know,
when they see seven girls, who the other is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t know for sure, and anyway, the boys
won’t know. You needn’t even tell Clayton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the matter was settled, and Dolly went off home
happy at having gained her point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the night of the party arrived. The girls
had planned not to let each other know what they
would wear, and see if they could guess identities.
Dolly and Dotty had no idea of each other’s costume,
and even Grace and Ethel Rawlins were in
equal ignorance of theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were to meet at the Rawlins house and
the boys at the Browns’ and go out to Uncle Jim’s
separately, in motor cars provided by the several
families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rawlins would act as hostess, and Mr. Rawlins
was a general manager, who seemed to look after
everything at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hour of meeting, Dolly found herself to be
the first one to arrive. She had come from home
by a roundabout way, and her father, who accompanied
her to the corner, stepped aside and let her
go up the steps alone, so that no one might suspect
it was she. Dolly was attired as a Ghost. Her dress
was lovely, being made of many layers of white tarlatan,
one over the other, with long angel sleeves, and
fluttering draperies, that wafted about as she walked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scarf of the same material enveloped her head
and neck, and trailed its long ends behind her. She
wore white silk gloves, but her hands were hidden
in the swirl of the misty material. She was a veritable
ghost, and deep in the shadows of her swathing
headgear, her face was concealed by a little white
satin mask. Of course her hair was completely hidden,
and she moved with slow, sinuous movements,
waving her draped arms in true spectre fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, Ghost,” said Mrs. Rawlins, as Dolly
stepped into the reception room. “Well, you are
a spirit, indeed! I never saw a real live ghost before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly swept long, ghostly curtseys, but said no
word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Rawlins came next. She had gone out and
around several blocks so that she might enter her
own house as a visitor. Grace was a Fairy. Her
dress was full and frilly, of pale pink crêpe paper,
and she had pink and gilt wings, and a long
wand. Her hair, which might have been recognisable,
was hidden in a dainty pink silk cap, with
a long gilt feather, and a full ruche of frilled paper
hid her neck and chin. A pink mask covered her
face, and she wore long pink silk gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly stared hard at her, but could not be sure
who it was. She thought the Fairy looked a little
like Maisie May, but never suspected Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maisie came next, though nobody knew it. She
was a Brownie. She had borrowed a suit from a
cousin out of town. The costume had been made for
a city party and was an exact Brownie rig. Of
course it completely disguised Maisie, and the goggle-eyed
mask was weird and quite appropriate to the
occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bernice came. She represented an Elf.
Her costume was made entirely of overlapping green
leaves, and a head-dress of the same. Green stockings
and slippers, green gloves and a green mask
made her entirely unrecognisable. Dolly thought it
was Dotty, as the two were much the same height.
Bernice moved about shyly, and sank into the first
chair she came to, and then Dolly felt sure it was
Dotty, trying to disguise her own brisk manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dotty did come, Dolly had no idea who it
was. Her costume was that of a witch. Long red
cloak and high peaked cap, from which hung straggling
grey locks. A red and black gown, red stockings
and black slippers, and a mask like that of a
little old lady with a hooked nose and apple-cheeks.
She carried a broom, gilded and tied with red ribbons.
It was a most picturesque garb, and Dolly
decided it must be Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one spoke to another. Occasionally one
would nod knowingly, as if to say she recognised
some one, or point a finger at her. But the other always
shook her head vigorously, as if the guess were
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was imperative that each should represent some
idea connected with the occasion, so Celia Ferris
came as Autumn. She wore yellow and brown with
touches of red, and she carried a basket of fruit.
Her head-dress was made of Autumn leaves, and she
wore long necklaces of cranberries strung on a
thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last to arrive was Ethel Rawlins. She had delayed
late, thinking that then no one would suspect
her identity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was The Nut Brown Maid. All her robe was
of brown, and it had fringes of nuts at the ends of
bits of ribbon. Her head-dress was trimmed with
chestnut burs, and she had necklace and armlets of
strung nuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the girls were all present, and though they
guessed, none knew positively who any other was.
Those who knew Bernice’s invitation had not told,
and those who did not know it, wondered greatly
who the seventh girl could be, though some surmised
correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rawlins laughingly collected her weird-looking
charges and packed them into two big motor
cars, and they set off for Uncle Jim’s,—for, at his
request, all the girls called him by that familiar title,—and
as the cars were swift ones, the party soon
reached the country house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word was spoken on the way, for the girls
found they were well disguised, and they determined
to keep up the mystery. But there was much giggling
and many expressive exclamations in deep guttural
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching their destination, a wonderful scene
awaited them. Uncle Jim had begged Mrs. Rawlins
to do anything she could to make the house
attractive and appropriate for the occasion. So,
with the help of the willing servants, she had transformed
the great hall and the big, old parlour into
a veritable Hallowe’en Revel. Branches of bright
Autumn leaves decked the walls. Red and yellow
cheesecloth made gay draperies, and streamers of red
and yellow crêpe paper fluttered here and there.
Hollowed-out pumpkins held masses of little late
chrysanthemums, and sheaves of grain stood in corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were jack-o’-lanterns, too, made of yellow
or of green pumpkins, and also of crook-neck
squashes, whose candles within lit up their strange
grotesque faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys had already arrived, and round the room
stood seven silent figures. They were dressed as
Robin Hood, Peter Pan, or merely as spooks and
goblins. Apparently the boys had been quite willing
to “dress up,” and their costumes were as picturesque
as the girls’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Jim greeted the incoming crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wal, wal, what a visitation! My, but ye’re a
lot of perty spooks! Look at this white ghost now!”
as Dolly swept him a long, low bow. “Ain’t she
the beauty? I ain’t afeard of ghostes like that, now,
you bet I ain’t! And see the Fairy! My stars!
Ye’re all so fine, I dunno which way to look first!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the boys advanced and greeted the girls with
bows, peering closely for some identifying sign, and
getting laughed at for their pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, here’s yer welcome,” said Uncle Jim.
“This is a writ welcome, fer the reason that I ain’t
much on expressin’ my thoughts. But I’m right
down glad to see ye all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then each received a pretty printed card, decorated
with designs of black cats and owls and witches
on broomsticks. It read:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This was read with nods of delight and the cards
laid away to take home as souvenirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin Hood stood near Dolly as she finished reading
hers, and he politely offered her a pencil to write
her name on it for safe-keeping. Then he eagerly
leaned over to see what name she wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O-o-o-o-h!” groaned Dolly in sepulchral tones,
and then she wrote <span class='it'>Ghost</span> on her card. But she
printed it in straggling letters, for she was too canny
to show her own penmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many were the traps laid to learn who was who,
but the secrets were, for the most part, well kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lollie Henry was discovered by his familiar laugh
and his inability to suppress it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maisie May was known, when a lock of her auburn
hair escaped from the queer Brownie head-covering.
Then, of course, these two being known, they tried
to make the others speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me who you are,” Lollie wheedled of the
Elf, Bernice. The only answer was a vigorous shake
of the green-leaved head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you needn’t tell, I know!” he exclaimed
triumphantly. “You’re Dotty Rose! I know by
the toss of your head. Aren’t you, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Elf nodded Yes with such insistence, that
Lollie felt sure his guess was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty as a witch, was in her element. She darted
about, tweaking people’s ears, or tapping their arms
with her broomstick. She had a funny little cackling
laugh, that was so unlike her own voice, it was not
recognised, though Dolly soon suspected her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hovered about Uncle Jim, teasing him until
the old man shook with laughter. “My! what a
witch it is!” he exclaimed. “Right from old Salem
Town, I’ll be bound!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They played all the regulation Hallowe’en games.
“Thread the Needle,” “Blow the Candle,” and all
the well-known ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Rawlins brought in a plate, which she
set on the table. “This,” said she, “is a test to see
who of you will be married this year. Now, who will
try first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls hung back, and the boys urged them forward.
At last, the Fairy flitted up to make the first
test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the plate was a mound of flour, tightly pressed
into shape. Mrs. Rawlins explained the test.
“You see,” she said, “the rule is, to fill a bowl with
flour, and drop a ring into it. Then press the flour
down so tightly, that it will keep its shape when
turned out on a plate. Each of you must cut out a
slice, and any one who finds the ring will be married
this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure?” asked Lollie Henry, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sure,” asserted Mrs. Rawlins, gravely.
“Come, Fairy, after I read the charm, cut your
slice. Cut it like a pie, and wherever you choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Rawlins read the charm:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Little ring within the flour,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Waiting for this witching hour,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Tell me where it is you hide —</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;On <span class='it'>this</span> side or on <span class='it'>this</span> side.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Now, with care the knife I bring —</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Do I get you, Little ring?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Now I cut! Just at this spot!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Do</span> I get you, Ring—or <span class='it'>not</span>?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The Fairy cut the slice, and all crowded round to
learn the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do <span class='it'>not</span>!” exclaimed Lollie, as there was no
ring seen in the Fairy’s slice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One after another, they each cut a slice, and even
to the very last one, no one secured the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not strange,” said Mrs. Rawlins, calmly, as she
took away the plate, “there wasn’t any ring in it!
Of course none of you children will be married this
year or for many years yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a great laugh went up at the way they had
been hoaxed, and Lollie said, comically, “Just my
luck! I thought I might get a rich wife, who would
promise to wait for me till I’m of age!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FORTUNES FOR ALL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> would seem that it would be easy to discover who
the spooks were, but the secrets were well kept. And
though several suspected that Bernice Forbes was
present, not one connected her with the green-robed
Elf. And somehow, the Elf was exceedingly popular.
She had merry little ways, and was among the
foremost ones in any game or trick. She was often
chosen as a partner in the Hallowe’en jokes, and
when at last it was supper time, when they would
all unmask, the Elf was watched with as much if not
more interest than the others. The boys chose partners
for the march out to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you,” said Lollie Henry, linking his
arm in that of the Elf. “I think you’re Dot Rose,
and yet, I think that red witch is Dotty, too. But
I mostly think you are, so come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Elf shook her head, hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that mean you won’t go with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another negative shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it means you’re not Dotty Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An affirmative nod to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right, I’ll soon find out who you are.
May I, fair Elf, escort you to the Spook Feast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lollie bowed low, and then Bernice accepted his
escort and they joined the line of march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was with Reggie Stuart, though neither of
them knew it, and Dotty was with Tod Brown, in
equally blissful ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They marched to the dining-room, and there
awaited them a true Hallowe’en table. Decked with
yellow paper and red ribbons, loaded with dainties of
all sorts, and crowded with little gnomes, witches,
black cats, owls and goblins for souvenirs, it was a
welcome sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all took their seats, and at a given signal
were bidden to remove their masks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rawlins gave the signal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready, everybody,” he said. “When I count
three, off with your face coverings. You’ve been
hidden long enough, and I for one will be glad to
see your happy smiles. One, two, three!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, already loosened, off came every mask, and
the flushed, smiling faces looked eagerly at each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was stunned when her eyes lighted on Bernice,
for she had concluded the Elf was really
Dotty, and she thought the red witch was Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But more surprised even than Dolly was Lollie
Henry. He caught sight of Bernice’s smiling face,
and he fairly jumped, as he involuntarily exclaimed,
“By Gum!” Then suddenly his good manners
came to his rescue, and though disappointed in his
partner, he managed to look pleasant, and went on.
“This is an unexpected pleasure! I didn’t know
you were to be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you wish I wasn’t!” Bernice flashed back,
for she didn’t misunderstand him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it! Haven’t I been chasing the
Elf around all the evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you didn’t know it was me.” Bernice’s
voice quivered a little. She had been so happy when
people were nice to her, and now she caught sight
of many surprised and not altogether pleased glances
thrown her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I didn’t know anybody, except red-headed
Maisie, when one of her rosy locks came out of her
Brownie cap. So how could you expect I’d know
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t expect it, and I’m glad you didn’t know
me, ’cause then you could be nice to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can be a whole lot nicer now that I do know
you, just you wait and see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech, and the pleasant smile that accompanied
it, were greatly to Lollie’s credit, for he didn’t
like Bernice, but having “got into it,” as he expressed
it to himself, he was bound to put it through, as he
further informed himself, “with a hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, Lollie laughed and chatted with Bernice
as well as with the others near him, and the Elf felt
a little better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But others were not so kind-hearted as Lollie, and,
too, they hadn’t his responsibility as a supper partner.
So, on the whole, few spoke to Bernice, while
all laughed and joked with the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty was not sitting near Dolly, but once, when
she caught her eye she frowned a little. However,
in the gay chatter that was general, no one had much
chance to think of personal matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Jim, himself, sat at the head of the table,
and Mr. and Mrs. Rawlins at the other end of the
wide board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is downright fine!” Uncle Jim said. “I’d
like to have a party like this about once or twice a
week. I declare I would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d get tired of us, sir,” suggested Tod
Brown. “We’re not always on such good behaviour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t, hey? Well, I calk’late you’re always
perty good. Good enough, anyway. Don’t want
childrun <span class='it'>too</span> good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Small danger of that, Uncle Jim,” cried Dolly,
laughing. “We’re none of us sprouting wings yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except Gracie, there!” and Uncle Jim laughed
at his Fairy niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure enough, I forgot Grace’s wings. But she’ll
moult ’em off to-morrow, and be no more angelic than
the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re all good enough for me. I think you’re
as fine a lot of little misses and masters as ever
I see. I’d like a picture of ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re going to have one, Uncle,” said Mr.
Rawlins, rising from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, with the help of Uncle Jim’s man he had
put in position a camera, and bidding them pose,
he took two or three flash-light pictures, which caused
great exclamations and startled shrieks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those things scare me to death, don’t they
you?” said Bernice to Reggie Stuart, who sat at
her other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he returned, rather uninterestedly. “I’m
sort of used to ’em. I’ve been taken a lot of times
that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you?” said Bernice. “How exciting!
Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as a matter of fact, Reggie’s experiences
were not so numerous as he implied, and most of
the times he had been “taken” were failures. So,
he only shrugged his shoulders and said, “Oh, I can’t
remember. It made so little impression on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice felt snubbed, and showed it by looking
cross. Reggie saw this, and saying to himself, “old
sourface!” he turned back to Dolly, who sat on his
other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Reg,” she said in a low tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For being nice to Bernie Forbes. I saw you
talking to her. She isn’t so bad, now, is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly, she’s the limit! and if you say B. F. to
me again to-night I’ll—I’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll what?” and Dolly laughed at the irate
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you out to Berwick Lake and drown
you all up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness sake! How ferocious! Well, be sure
to ask her for a couple of dances.” Roguish Dolly
knew Reg wouldn’t do this, but it did no harm, she
thought, to suggest it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper over, they returned to the big hall, and
sat around the roaring log fire, while the next entertainment
took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lollie escorted Bernice dutifully to a chair, and
then, feeling his duty done, he left her, and went
over to speak to Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wished that on me,” he said, accusingly.
“I thought she was you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Lollie Henry! I refuse to be mistaken
for Bernice Forbes! How dare you?” Dotty’s
dark eyes flashed and she looked a pretty picture in
her mock rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Needn’t get huffy,” returned Lollie, serenely.
“B. F. is some looker, all right. To-night, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice was a pretty girl, and her green costume
was exceedingly becoming, but the last few minutes
had not been pleasant ones, for since Lollie’s defection,
no one had spoken to her, and she looked resentful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” Dotty returned. “She might
be pretty if she didn’t look cross enough to bite a
nail in two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess she’s made that way, and can’t help it,”
said Lollie, and then they were called to attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to be Fortune Telling, Mr. Rawlins informed
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” he said, “if you will all seat yourselves
round the fire, I will tell each and every one of you
just what will happen in the years to come. Aren’t
you anxious to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we are!” cried several, as they took their
places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rawlins sat down at a table where were a
great many papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are Fortunes,” he said, indicating some
neatly folded sheets. “But it would never do to
give them out hit or miss. We must see to it that
they get where they belong. And this is the only
way it can be done. We will invoke the assistance
of the Fire Spirit. You know, Hallowe’en is the
birthday of the Fire Spirit or Sun Spirit, or some
such thing. My Mythology is a little rusty, but you
can ask your teachers in school to-morrow. However,
I’ve invoked for your aid to-night the Fire
Spirit, and he will help us get the Fortunes right.
Now, will some kind gentleman volunteer to help the
Fire Spirit help me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody offered, as the boys felt a little shy about
it, so Mr. Rawlins called on his son, Clayton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do, Son,” he said. “You’re not as handsome
as some of those other chaps, and not as wise as
some, but on the whole you’re a good sort, so come
on, and help your old dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clayton went up and stood by his father’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you see,” went on Mr. Rawlins, “all these
are Fortunes, and all these are small slips of blank
paper. I take a Fortune in my hand. I ask of thee,
O Fire Spirit, to tell me for whom it is meant!
Clayton, please hold a slip of blank paper to the
blazing fire. The Fire Spirit will write upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clayton picked up the top slip from the pile, and
did as he was told. As he held it, writing began to
appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Mr. Rawlins, as everybody watched a
name being written on the paper, by no means that
they could see. “Has the Fire Spirit written,
Son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-Yes, sir,” stammered Clayton, a little frightened
at what he saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you read it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; it says Dotty Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, this fortune is for Dotty, is it? I will read
it:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“You’ll have a career</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;More brilliant each year;</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;Ere you get what you will.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Take it, Dotty, and keep it always. It may serve
as a guidance to your feet in future years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty came and took the paper, a little bewildered.
“May I have the name the Spirit wrote?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, oh, yes, indeed. Treasure it carefully.
The Fire Spirit does not always respond to mortal’s
requests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty returned to her seat, and with the rest sat
breathlessly watching while Mr. Rawlins took up
another fortune paper, and motioned for Clayton to
hold out another blank paper for the Fire Spirit to
write on. “You’re sure it’s blank, are you, Clay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Father,” and the boy looked carefully on
both sides. It was pure white. He held it out to the
fire and soon it was written on, in a clear bold hand,
just like Dotty’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It says Grace Rawlins, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my Gracie’s fortune. I hope it will prove a
good one.” Mr. Rawlins then unfolded and read the
fortune he was holding.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“As you pass through future years</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Here are smiles and there are tears.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;But the passing days will show</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Far more happiness than woe.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Good for you, Grace, that’s a nice fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace stepped up and took her fortune and her
name paper, and then the next one was tried. This
time the Fire Spirit wrote Lorillard Henry, and the
verse ran:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For a few years, my boy, you may want for the pelf,</p>
<p class='line0'>But later in life you will earn it yourself.</p>
<p class='line0'>And as the years fly, you’ll get richer and richer,</p>
<p class='line0'>For you’re destined to be a professional pitcher.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>They all laughed at this, for Lollie’s love of baseball
was well known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another blank, Clayton, and hold it closer to the
Fire Spirit. He is old and he can’t see very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want to burn my fingers, Dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True that would be a pity. And you’re already
red-faced from the blaze. Well, try the tongs. It
may be more comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Clayton took a slip of blank paper, and fastened
it securely in the tongs’ grip and held it out
to the Fire Spirit in the flames. He began to write
at once, and in a moment the name Bernice Forbes
stood out clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rawlins read the paper he was holding:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>A very pretty fortune, Bernice, dear,—may it come
true.” Mr. Rawlins spoke so kindly, that Bernice’s
pale face glowed with pleasure as she took her two
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hold <span class='it'>my</span> name, mayn’t I?” asked Maisie
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know when your name will come,” returned
Mr. Rawlins. “It’s as the Fire Spirit decrees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me hold the next name, anyway. I
want to see how that Spirit holds his pen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” said Mr. Rawlins. “Always glad to
oblige. Let her take your place, Son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clayton gave the tongs to Maisie. With careful
scrutiny, she looked over the blank bit of paper before
she clutched it tightly in the tongs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let it drop into the fire,” cautioned Mr.
Rawlins, “or somebody will be without a fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” said Maisie, watching the paper carefully.
And sure enough, as she held it, the name
was slowly written thereon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Todhunter Brown,” she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Mr. Rawlins, “here goes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Tod,” said Lollie, “so you’ll get your
airship, then! Won’t that be fine! Give me a

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeedy. I’m glad old Fire Spirit knows
how much I want an airship, and maybe he’ll give me
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, fortune will, and it’s all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hold a paper once,” asked Dolly. “I
want to see how it is done, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dolly Fayre, don’t you seem to doubt the
Fire Spirit, or he may run away home and not tell
any more fortunes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I won’t hurt him. I just want to try it
once. Come on, Dot, let’s try it together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want to,” and as Dolly looked at her
in surprise, she added, “the fire burns my face so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, never knew you to be afraid of your complexion
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t want to, anyhow. Let Bernice
help you, if you need help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oho, so that was it! Dolly thought to herself.
Dotty was mad at Bernice’s presence at the party,
and took this means of showing it!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FIRE SPIRIT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dolly</span> glanced round to see if any one else had
noticed <a id='dot'></a>Dotty’s speech. Apparently, no one had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, deeming it best to ignore it, Dolly said, “Come
on, Bernice,” and laughingly drew the half-unwilling
Elf along with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are!” said Mr. Rawlins, gaily. “One
nice clean blank paper for each of you. Who’ll go
first? You, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; Bernice, you try it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So taking the paper carefully in the tongs, Bernice
held it to the blaze of the logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spirit of the Fire,” said Mr. Rawlins, in a
dramatic voice, “tell us, pray, whose is this Fortune
I have here, folded in my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then appeared on the paper, the name of
Maisie May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, our Maisie,” and Mr. Rawlins read:</p>

<p class='noindent'>Congratulations, Maisie, dear. May you be very

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t feel positively sure it will come true,”
laughed Maisie; “is it guaranteed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till ‘Some day’ and see,” returned Mr.
Rawlins. “Now, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was most anxious to know how the writing
appeared on the papers. She didn’t for a moment
believe in the Fire Spirit, but she was curious to know
the trick. She scrutinised her paper, but saw only
blank whiteness. Then she carefully put it in the
tongs, and held it to the fire. Sure enough, there
came the writing at once, and it said, Clayton Rawlins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is interesting,” exclaimed Clayton’s father.
“I’m glad to know the future of my children. Listen,

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Clayton; “I love peanuts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly gave it up. She couldn’t see how the trick
was accomplished. Mr. Rawlins let her try again,
and this time she read the name of Dolly Fayre, herself.</p>

right. I love adventure, and this sounds fine. Only
I wish I knew when the king and queen visits would

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the worst of fortunes,” observed Mrs.
Rawlins; “they leave so much to the imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then others wanted to try holding the papers.
But none could guess how a blank paper could be
written on by the fire, whether a spirit did it or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great, isn’t it?” cried Tad Brown, as he
watched the writing appear. “Joe Collins! Hullo,
Joe, what you s’pose your fortune will be? Something
desperate, ’ll bet. Joe’s a terror, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see;” and Mr. Rawlins read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Joe stopped prancing about and the others

Tad listened for his fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a monkey on a string!” chimed in Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flowers a-bloom and birds a-wing,” from Tad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catching coin like anything!” wound up Reggie.
“Oh, it’s a great life! I always envied the hand-organ
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fortunes over, Dolly begged Mr. Rawlins to
tell how the Fire Spirit was induced to write on the
blank papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a contract with the Spirit,” he declared,
“and if I order him, he will write for me. No one
else can command him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, now, I dunno ’bout that,” drawled Uncle Jim,
who had been an eager-eyed spectator of the fortune
telling, though he had said little. “S’pose, now,
Dolly, you hold up this here piece of blank paper an’
see if the Sperrit won’t write on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly took the sheet of paper offered her, and put
it in the tongs. Slowly some writing appeared. It
said: “Mr. Rawlins is fooling you. Make him tell,
(signed, The Fire Spirit.)”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” cried Dolly, and going to him, she
said, coaxingly: “Now, Mr. Rawlins, you must tell
us. The Fire Spirit commands you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall have to, of course,” and Mr. Rawlins
laughed good-naturedly. “Well, since you will
have the veil torn from the mystery, I’ll own up.
The way to produce that writing is simply to write
it on the papers beforehand, with milk—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With milk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, use a small paint brush dipped in milk.
Write your message, let it dry, and then when it is
held to the fire the heat turns the milk brown and the
writing appears. But, when I let Uncle Jim into
my secret, I didn’t know he would turn it against
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have told us, anyway,” and Dolly
nodded her head at him. “But it’s a good trick.
Does it always work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you do it properly. It’s well to go over
the milk letters a second time, while they are wet
enough to see. Then the heat scorches them better.
Also, have a care not to let the papers be handled or
blurred before using.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, that’s a fine thing to know,” and
Dolly tucked it away in her noddle for future use.
She already saw herself mystifying Bert and Bob
when they came home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great, isn’t it, Dot?” she cried, her first thought,
as always, to share every idea with Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again, Dotty gave her the cold shoulder. She
heard, but, pretending not to, she turned to Celia and
chattered quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly gave her a hurt look, and then, as Dotty
glanced at her without a responding smile, Dolly
went deliberately across the room to where Bernice
stood, alone and neglected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was in defiant mood. She was full of wrath
at Dotty’s attitude, and she was angry, too, at the
boys, because they would not be nice to Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Bernie,” she said. “How’d you like your
fortune?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like anything,” returned Bernice, her eyes
stormy with discontent. “I want to go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all going,” said Dolly, “after one dance.
Uncle Jim wants to see us do a Virginia Reel, and
Mrs. Rawlins is going to play for us. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody will ask me to dance. I want to go
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then, Tad came up to Dolly and asked her to
dance with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you find a partner for Bernice,” said
Dolly. She spoke in a low tone, and they turned
away, so Bernice did not hear. But she imagined
what they were saying, and it did not tend to make
her happier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t do it,” said Tad, positively. “Nobody
will dance with that lemon! Why, look at her, Doll!
She’s a human thunder-cloud. Who’d dance with
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll dance with her, myself. I’d rather do
that, than have her left out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fiddlesticks! Leave her alone, and let’s get
our places. You can’t scare me, saying you’ll dance
with her! No, sir, not little Dolly Fayre. She’s
going to trip it with yours truly, and that’s all there
is about that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dolly had an inspiration. “Wait a
minute,” she said to Tad, and she ran over to where
Uncle Jim was smiling at his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going to dance, Uncle Jim?” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I hadn’t thought on’t. But it’s right
down nice of you to ask me. I’d like to,—by gum,
I’d like to! But which of all these perty young
misses would dance with me? I ask you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, any of them would be proud to dance with
the host. I would myself, only I’m engaged for it.
But how do you like the Elf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That perty one in green? I’d like her mighty
well, if she’d honor me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go and ask her,” and Dolly led the old man
across to Bernice. “Say, Bernie, you’re the belle of
the ball! Uncle Jim wants you to dance the Reel with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I do, if you would give me the honor,” and
Uncle Jim made an old-fashioned bow, of deference
and respect. He had the grace of an old-time beau,
and it appealed to Bernice’s pride to be chosen by the
host of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said, a little shyly, and took
the arm of the old man, as they found places in the
line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was beaming at her success. “It’s all right,
no thanks to you,” she said to Tad, as she returned to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a hummer, Dolly, and no mistake!
That was a first-rate scheme. You couldn’t have
made any of the boys take her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” and Dolly sighed. Then she changed
the subject, for she had no wish to discuss Bernice
further just then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it turned out, Uncle Jim was a fine dancer, and
he cut pigeon wings and made old-fashioned bows,
with his hand on his heart. Bernice, also a good
dancer, entered into the spirit of the quaint dance,
and they were by far the most effective couple on the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a grand finale, Uncle Jim balanced up and
down the line with Bernice in gay whirls, and then
fairly swung her off her feet, in a wild pirouette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Mr. Rawlins, clapping his hands.
“Didn’t know you were such a gay young buck,
Uncle Jim! You’ll have to come to dancing class
and teach the youngsters the real thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flushed and smiling, Bernice said good-night to
her host and partner, and ran away to the cloakroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were splendid, Bernie,” said Dolly, as she
put on her wrap. “Wasn’t she, Dot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dotty, coldly. “But I don’t care for
such boisterous dancing myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t!” said Dolly, mad clear through.
“Well, keep your preferences and opinions to yourself!”
She turned her back on Dotty, and adjusted
her scarf before the mirror. Her pink cheeks were
scarlet, and her blue eyes flashed with indignation.
It was the injustice of Dotty’s attitude that hurt her.
She had only tried to give Bernice a good time, and
she couldn’t see why that should make Dot so horribly
snippy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she heard exclamations and shouts out in the
hall, and hurried out to see what it meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first she thought the house was on fire. A red
glow showed through the windows and from the open
door. Then she discovered that it was a glow of red
fire in honour of the occasion. Uncle Jim had arranged
it to give them a gay and pleasant send-off.
There were fires burning in all directions, and the
effect was a general red glow as bright as day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful!” cried everybody, for the scene
was like fairyland. And then they all thanked Uncle
Jim over and over for the party, and for his kindness
and thoughtfulness, and the motors came, and the
young people were packed in and sent rolling homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was a little silent, for she was deeply hurt
at Dotty’s manner, and had to think things over before
she decided what to do about it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty, on the other hand, was unusually gay. She
proposed singing songs, and herself started the tunes.
She laughed and chattered with everybody else, but
said no word to Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached their respective homes, the
girls went into their houses without a parting word
of good-night to each other.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MAD AND MEASLES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> next day was Saturday, and the Two D’s had
planned to spend the morning at Treasure House,
studying first, and afterward arranging for a
luncheon they were going to have there the next Saturday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They intended to ask four girls and have a lovely
party, but now the very thought of it brought the
tears to Dolly’s eyes. She was in her room, wondering
whether to go over to Treasure House or to wait
for some word from Dotty. They had never had a
real quarrel before and Dolly didn’t know quite how
to manage it. So she watched from her window to
see if Dot would go over. And Dotty did. Soon
Dolly saw her walking along the path, her head up,
singing a little song, and then she unlocked the door
of Treasure House and went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dolly followed, and went in to find that Dotty
had started a good fire, and was sitting at her desk,
studying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked at Dotty and Dotty looked at Dolly,
but neither spoke. Dolly thought Dotty looked spiteful
and Dotty thought Dolly looked stubborn. And
they both did look so, and they felt so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly threw off her coat, laid another log on the
blazing fire, and sat down at her desk to study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence reigned and reigned with such absolute
monarchy that each girl felt as if she should scream.
Perhaps you know the tension of such a situation.
Both sat still, until arms and legs felt rigid, faces
were strained, and hearts beat as if they would burst.
Yet, neither felt she could speak. That would be a
humiliating admission of being in the wrong, which
neither was willing to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turned slightly away from each other, they were
not mutually visible, yet each felt that the other
knew every move she made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was almost ready to cry, her neck felt so stiff
and her arm so cramped. She moved a trifle, and
the sensation was as if she had made a disturbance in
church. She at once became motionless again, her
burning face showing her embarrassed self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty of sterner stuff sat stiffly still, now and
then turning a page of her book with utmost deliberation.
Then her foot went to sleep, and she
wanted to get up and dance on it. Of course, there
was no reason why she shouldn’t dance on it to her
heart’s content, but if you are acquainted with the
peculiar etiquette of “getting mad,” you know she
would have endured torture before she would have
done anything that could have been construed as
sociable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two silly things sat there, each trying to
study, pretending to study, and really wondering
what the other was thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the burned out fire required mending.
With a furtive glance at Dotty, Dolly got up, sauntered
to the wood-box, selected a log with care, and
laid it carefully on the embers of the expiring ones
glowing among the ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty jumped up, glad of a chance to step on her
sleeping foot, and seizing the poker, jammed Dolly’s
log into place so fiercely that it fell down between the
andirons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ’tend to the fire,” said Dolly, coldly, for a
speech of this sort was entirely permissible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think you know all about fire-making, don’t
you? Well, that big log will never burn without a
stick of kindling-wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would, if you’d let it alone. You always poke
a fire till you put it out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t either! I had the fire all right, till you
came over and bothered with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, fix it yourself, smarty, if you know
so much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly flounced back to her chair and sat down.
Usually gentle, and even-tempered, when Dolly did
get stirred up, she was so miserable, all through, that
she couldn’t control herself. And now, she knew that
if she staid there with Dotty, in those strained relations,
she would very shortly burst into uncontrollable
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty slammed another log on top of the first one,
took the hearth brush and flirted the ashes about a
little, took the tongs, and fussed about with those,
and then, adjusting the fender with meticulous care,
went back to her seat, and again silence took up its
sceptre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very light-ticking clock could be plainly heard,
indeed it sounded as loud as the click of a typewriter
in the gloomy atmosphere. The girls turned
farther away from each other until they were fairly
back to back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was all the time growing more and more inclined
to tears; not tears of sorrow, so much as of
indignation, of weariness and of general nerve strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty, tearless, with no inclination to cry, became
more and more ruffled with anger at Dolly, and a
vague half-recognised jealousy of Bernice; as well
as a sort of remorse at her own unkindness to her
chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what could be done? Girls who are “mad at”
each other can not violate the age-old canons of not
speaking, and to speak first was the deepest humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two little ninnies sat there. Dotty’s feet
went to sleep, one after the other. Dolly’s arms
stiffened and relaxed in turn. The minutes dragged
by like hours. Lessons were not learned, for how
can one put one’s mind on the Ptolemies or their successors,
when one is mad at one’s friend?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, somehow, the motionless hour-hand of the
hammering clock managed to worm its way to twelve,
a permissible, if not usual, hour to go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously, and with the same air of preoccupied
intentness, both girls put away books and
papers, and pulled on her coat sleeves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly dawdled over her desk a moment, hoping
Dotty would speak. Dotty looked at the back of
Dolly’s head, decided it still looked stubborn, and
turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together, yet miles apart, they went out of the
door. Dotty locked it with her key, she was always
the quicker one at that, and then, with an assumed
lightness of step, the two silly young things ran
across their respective lawns and into their respective
homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merry and bright they were at their respective
luncheon tables, for the unwritten law required that
their parents must not know of the tragedy that had
befallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, when Mrs. Fayre informed Dolly that her company
was desired for a ride that afternoon, the consent
was prompt and willing. And when Mrs. Rose
asked Dotty to stay with Genie while she went out
on some errands, there was no objection raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were two sore and sorry hearts in the
neighbouring houses, and two brains pondered over
the question of what was best to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was unwilling to give up her pet plan of helping
Bernice. She couldn’t explain entirely to her
own satisfaction, just why she was so interested in
this project, but she knew she had no unworthy
motive. It was not,—of that she was sure,—because
Bernie was rich and lived in the grandest house
in Berwick. It was not because she wanted her for
her own particular friend. But it seemed too bad
that a nice girl like that should be out of everything
for lack of a guiding hand. And, it must be
admitted, Dolly liked to play the part of guiding
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty, for her part, was mad because Dolly had
gone off and asked the girls to invite Bernice to their
party, after she had practically agreed not to.
This was Dolly’s sole argument. The fact of her
own jealousy of Dolly’s interest in Bernice she ignored,
for the present, at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two foolish ones spent much of the golden
Autumn afternoon ruffling the feathers of their souls,
and persistently keeping them ruffled.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, as the Fayres sat at dinner, the telephone
rang, and Mrs. Fayre was asked for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she returned to the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a state of things,” she said, smiling, yet
looking serious too. “It was Mrs. Rose telephoning.
Genie has the measles, or rather, they think
she has, and so Mrs. Rose asks if we’ll let Dotty come
here to stay till they’re over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Mr. Fayre, “that’s too bad for
poor little Genie. But I rather think I can guess
the names of Two D’s who won’t be sorry about
the projected visit. Eh, Dollykins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was stricken dumb. Dotty coming for a
week, maybe more,—how long did measles last, anyway?
Was it a month? Could they go without
speaking all that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How—how long will she be here, Mother?” at
last a small, scared voice said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A couple of weeks, I daresay. Why,—aren’t
you glad? I thought you’d be overjoyed. Not at
Genie’s illness, but at Dotty’s coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did—did you tell her she could come, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, child. Won’t you have the good times,
though!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can have the pink guest room,” said Trudy,
kindly. “That’s almost next to Doll’s room, and
they can chum all they like. Hasn’t Dotty been
exposed, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but she has had measles, so she’s immune.
But she can’t go to school if she remains in the
house where the illness is. So she’s to come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” asked Dolly, in a queer, far-away voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now; right away,” replied her mother. “We’ll
put aside that best lace bed-set, Trudy, and give her a
plainer one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I’ll fix the room, Mother, you
needn’t give it a thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a great help, Trude,” said Mrs. Fayre,
smiling at her elder daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the younger daughter of the house of
Fayre was struggling with her emotions. She didn’t
know whether to be sorry or glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And before she had time to decide, Dotty arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t this great?” she exclaimed in a state of
excitement. “It’s awful kind of you, Mrs. Fayre,
to take me in, but you see, I’d hate so to be out of
school just now. It’s near examinations, and I do
want to pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll pass you,” said Mr. Fayre. “We’ll put
you through, with bells on! But I expect you Two
D’s will chatter and giggle all the time instead of
studying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, we won’t,” and from the cold smile Dotty
flashed at her, Dolly understood the feud was as desperate
as ever, but the elders were to be kept in ignorance
of it. For a feud suspected by parents is as
good as finished. No real feud can exist in the scathing
beams of grown people’s ridicule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dolly smiled coldly in return, and said, “No,
indeed,” in a tone that ought not to have deceived a
feeble-minded jellyfish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did it deceive Trudy. “Something’s up,”
she thought, but wisely kept her thoughts to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, when the girls went to bed, they parted at
their doorways in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Dollyrinda,” said Dotty, heartily,
in a voice loud enough to be heard down-stairs, if
any one chanced to be listening. “I’m fearfully
tired, so I’ll go right to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Dotsie,” returned the other guileful
one. “You must be tired, with the worry about
Genie, and all. Good night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door shut and there was silence as far as the
Two D’s were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can it be?” thought Trudy, who had heard
the high-pitched conversation. But she bided her
time to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was a trial. Being Sunday, the
whole family was much together. The Two D’s
were at their wit’s end to preserve an apparent
friendliness, without showing each other any real
diminution of their desperate hatred of one another.
Trudy eyed them, when she could do so unobserved,
and concluded that they were “mad at” each other.
“Silly little geese!” she thought, well remembering
her own not so far past schooldays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She determined to give them every chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going over to Treasure House?” she inquired,
soon after dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. Do you want to go, Dot?” said Dolly,
with studied carelessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t care, Dolly. Just as you like,” and
Dotty’s politeness was faultless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you do,” said Mr. Fayre, looking up
from his paper. “What did I build that house for
if you’re not to use it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go, Dot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly did not like, at all, but Mr. Fayre spoke up
again. “Run along over, kiddies, and after a while,
I’ll saunter over myself. I haven’t been there for a
week, and I like to keep in touch with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Dad. Come on, Dotty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls went across the lawn, side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder how Genie is,” said Dolly, with the laudable
intention of “making talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t sick, you know,” returned Dotty, courteously.
“The doctor isn’t sure it really is measles.
But he’ll know in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went into Treasure House. Something
about the look of the place got on Dolly’s nerves.
The lovely house, the dear furniture, the beautiful
treasures, and then—the two owners acting like a
pair of silly idiots,—it was too much! But, whereas
yesterday, she had felt sad and distressed, the long
trying hours had made her irritable and angry, and
as the door closed behind them, she burst out, “I
think you’re perfectly <span class='it'>horrid</span>, Dotty Rose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I think <span class='it'>you</span> are, Dolly Fayre!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>idea</span> of being mad at me, just because I want
to do a deed of kindness for a friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She <span class='it'>isn’t</span> your friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course she’s my friend—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hardly know her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t have to know people such an awful
lot to be friends with them,—not if they’re nice
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! I s’pose I’m not nice people, then.
You’re not very friendly with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither are you with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do you know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why, and I don’t care why. If
you want old Bernice Forbes for your friend instead
of me, you can have her, I don’t care!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want her instead of you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do so! You like her because she’s—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stop that, Dotty Rose! Don’t you dare
say that! I’ll like her if I want to,—so there now,
and you can think whatever you please! I don’t care
<span class='it'>what</span> you think!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A step on the porch sounded, and the angry combatants,
ashamed to be caught quarrelling, ran back
to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you, ladies of the house?” called out
Mr. Fayre, as he and Mrs. Fayre stepped into the
study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, be there in a minute,” called Dotty in
a cheery voice, as she mopped her heated brow with
her handkerchief, and straightened her rumpled
collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in a moment, two normally serene girls came
in the room to receive their guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you talking about as we came up the
steps?” asked Mrs. Fayre, in idle curiosity; “you
were speaking so loudly and excitedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were—” began Dolly, and stopped. She
was a truthful child, and since she didn’t want to
state the facts, she preferred to say nothing. Dotty
too, began to speak and stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Mother,” said Mr. Fayre, laughing,
“let the girls have their little secrets.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FEAST THAT FAILED</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>That</span> night the Two D’s put off going to bed as long
as possible, and when, at last, Mrs. Fayre sent them
away, laughingly, they marched up-stairs like two
deaf and dumb Drum Majors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with the kiddies?” asked Mr.
Fayre, who couldn’t help noticing their demeanour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” returned his wife. But
Trudy laughed outright, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do. They’re mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. A school girl ‘mad,’ you know. Neither
will speak first—it’s beneath her dignity. They’ll
act like this a day or two longer, and then they’ll
make up. I know ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better speak to them, Mother,” suggested Mr.
Fayre, “and clear up matters. Seems silly to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t believe I’d better interfere. They’ll
fix it up themselves, if that’s what’s the matter.
Some foolish quarrel, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t like them. They rarely quarrel.”
Trudy looked thoughtful. “But I’m sure it is that.
They never spoke to each other at supper, though
each was gay and chatty with the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly babies!” said Mr. Fayre, smiling. “Let
them work it out themselves, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the “silly babies” were tossing on restless
pillows. In adjoining rooms, Dolly and Dotty
were thinking hard, though in different moods.
Dotty was tumbling about the bed, throwing her arms
out and digging her face in her pillow, in the intensity
of her warring emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was lying quiet and straight, her eyes turned
toward the ceiling, her heart throbbing, as she
“thought it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both rooms were flooded with moonlight, and the
two girls stayed awake far into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, about one o’clock, Dolly finished her cogitations.
Deliberately, she rose and put on her dressing-gown
and slippers. She went to Dotty’s room,
opened the door softly and walked in. Then she
closed the door behind her, and going to the bedside,
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You awake, Dots?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep,” came the surprised voice from the rumpled
coverlets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sit up here, then. I’ve come to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t—isn’t it late?” and Dotty sat up, a little
uncertain what attitude to assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s late. But I’ve got to have this
thing out. I can’t go on this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I either, Doll!” and Dotty leaned forward
and threw her arms around Dolly’s neck in a convulsive
hug that nearly strangled her. “Aren’t we the
silly geese to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you wait, Dotty Rose. After I say what
I’ve come to say, you may not want—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will, Dolly! I don’t care <span class='it'>what</span> you’re
going to say. You may jump on me all you like,—I
<span class='it'>was</span> a pig, but I’m sorry, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, too! You shan’t be sorry before I
am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have to, Doll! You know I’m always
<span class='it'>everything</span> before you are. I’m quicker-jointed, or
something. But never mind that, I’ve got you back,
you dear old thing, and now you can go ahead and
scold me, all you want to. Oh, Doll, hasn’t it been
horrid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hasn’t</span> it! Well, as we’re all right again, let’s
have this Bernice business out once and for all. If
you say so, Dotty, I’ll give up trying to make her
more popular. I’ve thought it all out, and it’s this
way. You’re my best friend, and I want you to be,
and if it bothers you so to have me friendly with her,—why,
I won’t be, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dollyrinda, how sweet you are! You make
me feel like an awful pig. But you see,—well, I
s’pose I was jealous. I thought you’d like Bernice
more and more, till you liked her better’n everybody
and better’n me. And I just couldn’t stand
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dorothy Rose! The idea of your thinking
<span class='it'>that</span>!” and Dolly clasped the tousled black head
to her breast and kissed the tear-wet cheeks. “We’re
special friends, nobody could come between <span class='it'>us</span>!
They’d just better try it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s all right!” and Dotty’s quick-working
mentality jumped to a happy conclusion of their
troubles. “Now, look here, Doll, you don’t have to
throw Bernice over entirely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, if you want me to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want you to. Your idea of making
her one of our set is all right, now that I know <span class='it'>we’re</span>
all right. And I’ll help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you? Oh, Dot, then we can do it. We’ll
have to plan it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course! You’d have to plan, if it was only
to eat your dinner!” and Dotty affectionately pulled
the golden curls. “And say, old Dollypops, we
haven’t planned much for our luncheon next Saturday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t very well, when we were mad. Oh, Dot,
wasn’t it horrid in the house yesterday morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrid all the time. Hasn’t to-day been awful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. But it was funny you had to come over
here to stay just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awful funny. Now about Saturday—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir! Not <span class='it'>now</span> about Saturday. Do you
know what time it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nixy; and I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do. It’s ’most two o’clock, and Mother
will give us Jesse to-morrow if she hears us talking so
long. So you go by-by, and I will too, and we’ll plan
by daylight. Good night, old girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Dollums, and I am sorry I was horrid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I, that I was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And peace being declared and ratified, the Two
D’s went to sleep so successfully that they were late to
breakfast.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>“The country’s safe,” remarked Trudy, after the
pair had started for school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” asked her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Signs. Lots of ’em. They talked <span class='it'>to</span> each other,
not <span class='it'>at</span> each other. And they smiled and sang, and
were generally in fine spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad of it. I hate to have them so
childish and silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’spect all girls are. They’ll outgrow it. And
they are two such sensible, nice, little girl chums, that
I don’t believe it will happen often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did it. In all their lives, Dotty and Dolly
never again had one of those foolish “mads” that
most school girls know so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had differences of opinion frequently, very
frequently; and often they had hot, hasty words; but
the quarrels were of short duration, and ended amicably
and lovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Saturday luncheon was duly planned. They
invited Maisie, the two Rawlins girls and Celia.
Dolly would have liked to ask Bernice and Dotty was
more than willing, but they had only room for six,—and
too, they knew all the girls would like it better
without the stranger, and so for this time they decided
against her, agreeing that they would invite her
some time soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to be a very festal occasion. More, the
whole luncheon was to be the work of the two girls
themselves. Not everything was to be made in
Treasure House, but no one save the Two D’s could
have a hand in the preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, when Saturday morning came, they were
up bright and early to begin their work. Dotty was
still at the Fayres’; Genie, though better was still
housed, and the time was not yet up when Dotty
could return home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem fair, Doll,” said Dotty as, swathed
in big aprons, they went into the Fayre kitchen, “for
me to work over here. We’ve always divided the work
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter. What do you want for the
cake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big bowl and a spoon. I’ll measure out the
things myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, and I’ll make the salad dressing now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two busy bees worked all the morning, barely having
time to set the table in Treasure House and arrange
some flowers there before their guests came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, there they are!” cried Dotty, as she
set a saucepan of lard on their kitchenette stove to
heat. “I can’t leave this, Doll, so you go in and do
the polite, and I’ll run in when I can. They won’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dolly, serene and smiling, met the girls, who all
came together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a jolly lark!” exclaimed Maisie; “the idea
of you two girls having a lunch party!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And cooking everything ourselves,” added Dolly.
“Dot’s in the kitchen yet, struggling with foods.
Take off your things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guests complied, keeping up a perfect stream
of chatter as they looked about and admired everything
in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All had been there before, but not to a regular invited
feast, and the occasion was a great one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had a house like this,” declared Ethel Rawlins,
“I wouldn’t ask any more favours of Fate for
twenty years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” agreed Celia. “Isn’t it wonderful!
Don’t you just adore it, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we do—yes, all right!” This last in
answer to a frantic call from Dotty, in the kitchenette.
“Excuse me, girls, Dot’s come to grief, somehow.
Amuse yourselves till I come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly hurried to the rescue, and found Dotty
throwing dish-towels into the croquette kettle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old thing caught fire somehow!” she exclaimed,
dancing about, “and, I never thought of it
before, but, Dolly, do you think the house is insured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, I don’t know! But never mind that,
now; it isn’t going to burn down. Can we save the
croquettes, or what shall we have for lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gingerly with a fork they picked up the towels,
and found a number of black, dried-up cylinders that
had once been Dotty’s carefully shaped croquettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing doing!” said Dolly, philosophically, as
she gazed at the charred remains. “You got the lard
too hot, Dotsie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I notice! Well, we’ll have to cut out the croquette
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter. I’ll skip over home and get a platter
of cold lamb, there was a lot left last night, I know.
You chin with the girls, and I’ll fly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly scooted out at the back door of Treasure
House, and across to her own home, and soon returned
with a dainty dish of sliced lamb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she busied herself with her own allotment of
the preparations, and began to heat the soup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Most ready?” said Dotty, flying in suddenly,
and startling Dolly so she nearly dropped the pepper-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a minute. Fill the water glasses, set the
fruit thing-a-ma-jigs on the table, cut the bread,—oh,
no, we have rolls,—well, get them fixed, and hunt
up the butter and—oh, my gracious, the salad has
upset!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely; I can straighten it out, I guess.
Oh, why did we ask them to come so early! I’ve
heaps to do. You put the cocoa in the silver pot,
won’t you? and, oh Dot, the olives haven’t been
opened yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it. Where’s the opener-thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I guess there isn’t any over
here—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess there is. Here it is, but it won’t work.
You give it a pull, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both girls, together and in turn, pulled at the refractory
cork of the olive bottle,—for without olives,
no school girl lunch is complete! But it refused to
budge. Now, the ways of corks are most mischievous.
Just as they were about to give it up, a last strong
pull brought the cork out with a jerk, and the two
D’s fell in a heap in the middle of the kitchenette,
with such a clatter of accompanying dishes, that the
guests came running out to see what was the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found their hostesses scrambling up from the
floor, laughing, but pretty much upset withal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was that old cork,” explained Dotty. “It
wouldn’t come out, and then all of a sudden it couldn’t
get out quick enough! ’Scuse us girls, for such a
racketty performance, but truly, everything is going
screw-wampus to-day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us help,” begged Grace; “oh, do let us,
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do help,” said Dolly, who was at the end of
her rope. “You, Grace, see if everything is on the
table that ought to be there. Ethel, please put some
sugar in this bowl,—there’s the box,—and Celia,
won’t you set these salad plates on the side table?
Maisie May, you just stand around and look pretty,—I
don’t know of anything else for you to do. Now,
I’ll take up the soup, oh, no, I won’t. We must eat
the fruit thingumbob first. Come on, let’s do that.
I don’t see how people <span class='it'>ever</span> get the things ready at the
right time. Everything here is either too ready or
not enough so. Come on, friends. You sit here,
Maisie, and Grace, here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughing gaily, the girls took their seats, and delightedly
attacked the dainty first course. It was a
combination of various fruits,—orange, pineapple
and crimson cherries, served in delicate slender-stemmed
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just love this fruit muddle,” said Maisie, “and
this is the best ever! Who made it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Dolly, with pardonable pride. “It
took most of the morning, though, that’s why everything
else fell behind. It isn’t hard to make, but it
takes forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Two D’s were to take turns in changing the
plates, so Dolly rose to bring in the soup. Very
pretty it looked, in the bouillon cups, but after the
first taste Celia hurriedly caught up her glass of
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out!” she cautioned, but too late. Nearly
every girl had taken a spoonful of soup, before she
discovered it was burning hot with pepper! When
Dotty had come upon Dolly in the act of seasoning the
soup, she startled her so, that far more pepper went
in than was meant, and the result was appalling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly the girls sipped the cold water, and with
tears running down their cheeks from the pungent
taste and odour, they protested that “they didn’t
mind it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like peppery soup,” said Grace, politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t like soupy pepper, do you?”
gasped Dotty, “and that’s what this is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dolly, crestfallen and chagrined, but trying
to be merry, took away the soup, and brought the
cold lamb, and the salad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lamb was all that it should be; but the salad
dressing had separated itself into its original ingredients,
after the manner of some ill-natured salad
dressings. This was harrowing, but Dolly smiled
bravely, and acknowledged it was her first attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you mind, Doll,” said Grace, comfortingly;
“not one of us could make a better one. And with
the olives and all, you don’t notice anything the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the crowning blow came with the dessert. The
girls had made lovely home-made ice cream, and had
frozen it with the greatest care. This they felt sure
would be right, for they had made it before many
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas, by some oversight, the freezer had been
left outdoors in the sun, the ice had been insufficient,
and the result, instead of a finely moulded form, was
a lot of thick creamy liquid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you care!” cried Ethel. “I just <span class='it'>love</span>
soft ice cream. Call it a pudding, and let it go at
that. Come, Dot, brace up. Who cares for the occasional
slips of young housekeepers? Cut the cake
and pass it to us, and give us some of that delicious-looking
ice cream custard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cake had turned out fairly decent, but not up
to the mark. Dotty was a good cake maker but
making it in a strange kitchen and baking it in a
strange oven had made a difference, and the fluffy
sponge cake she usually achieved, showed up a close,
almost soggy, and very sticky compound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just ready to cry,” said Dotty, as she looked
at the dessert, from which they had hoped such great
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do anything so foolish,” said Dolly. “We
slipped up on ’most everything, but we tried hard
enough, goodness knows! If you’re hungry, girls,
there are cookies in the cupboard, and there’s plenty
of cocoa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take some, please,” said Maisie, so plaintively,
that they all laughed. And then they all fell
to on the previously despised cookies, and under the
cheer and raillery of their guests, the two D’s finally
regained their poise, and laughed themselves at their
chapter of accidents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it ‘The Feast That Failed,’ and let it go at
that,” said Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t a failure at all,” protested Celia.
“We’ve had heaps of fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it <span class='it'>was</span> a failure,” insisted Dotty; “and we’ll
have to learn to do better. Why, when the boys come
home, they’ll make all sorts of fun of us, if we can’t
do better than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We <span class='it'>will</span> do better than this,” declared Dolly.
“We’ll ask you again, girls, and show you how great
an improvement second attempts are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m glad of this frolic,” said Grace, “for
it means we get two parties instead of one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what you might have expected,” said Trudy,
laughing till the tears rolled down her cheeks at the
D’s’ account of the feast. “You little geese, not to
know that you couldn’t do it! Now, I’ll take you
in hand, and give you a few practical lessons, and then
when the boys come home, you can astonish them with
your skill and dexterity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dolly. “I’ll try to learn, won’t
you, Dots?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I rather just guess yes!” exclaimed the
other D.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NEWS INDEED!</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a piece of news for you,” said Mr. Fayre, as
the family sat at dinner one night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Dads?” asked Dolly, as her father
paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still silent, and his face looked a little grave
as his eyes rested in turn on his two daughters and on
their guest, for Dotty was still there. After a
moment, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it will hit you hard, Trudy, and I know
it will make Dolly miserable. So I hate to tell you.
But it must be told. I’ve been ordered to Buffalo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the girls didn’t take in just what he
meant, then Trudy cried, “Go to Buffalo! To live?
All of us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Trude, I certainly couldn’t leave any of my
family behind me. Mother and I are going, and I
guess you girls better come along too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly sat looking at her father, her eyes very wide
and very blue as she thought over what he was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t do it,” she said, finally, and as if she
were disposing of the whole matter: “I can’t go away
from Berwick to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Dolly dear, where would you live, here alone?
In Treasure House?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can live with me!” exclaimed Dotty, excitedly.
“Why, she’ll <span class='it'>have</span> to. I won’t let my Dollyrinda
go away from Berwick. She’s mine, and I’ve
got to keep her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it really true, Father?” asked Trudy, looking
very thoughtful. “Must we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear,” answered Mr. Fayre. “The company
has transferred me to the Buffalo office, and
I must obey or leave the road. You know a freight
superintendent is under orders from his superiors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t anybody superior to you, Daddy,”
said Dolly, who was looking blank and stunned at the
news she had heard. “Can’t you tell the president,
or whoever is sending you, that you won’t go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might, Dolly; but that might mean my entire
dismissal, and who’d buy your hair-ribbons then, my
girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to Buffalo!” wailed Dolly. “We might as
well go to Timbuctoo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awful,” said Trudy, with a long-drawn sigh.
“Did you know about it, Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, some days ago. And I knew how sorry you
girls would feel. But I know you’ll brace up and
meet the disappointment bravely, for Father’s sake.
He doesn’t want to hurt his girls so, but he can’t help
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will Bert say?” said Dolly; “won’t he be
mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Bert will care as much as you girls,”
began Mr. Fayre, when Dotty interrupted: “My
Dollyrinda <span class='it'>shan’t</span> go! I won’t have it! I’ll make
my father buy her for me, and keep her here! That’s
what I’ll do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly, Dots,” said Dolly, who was beginning
to realise that this thing was a fact. Apparently
her parents had already become used to the idea,
and were regretting it principally on the girls’ account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to go, Father?” Dolly asked.
“Would you just as lieve live in horrid old Buffalo
as here in beautiful, lovely Berwick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dolly, I wouldn’t. But I must obey orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose orders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The general manager, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s Mr. Forbes, isn’t it? Bernice
Forbes’ father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he sending you away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not directly; that is, not personally. But he
and the board of directors have combined to decree
this thing. They consider it an honour, Dolly. It is
a better position, financially, and I have earned it by
my integrity and exemplary behaviour!” Mr. Fayre
smiled at his younger daughter, and was so honestly
sorry for her that he didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Daddy, I can’t stand it,” and Dolly shook
her head. “I’ll just die, that’s all. I couldn’t live
anywhere except here. You couldn’t get me another
Treasure House, or another Dotty Rose, or all our
crowd at school, or anything that I have here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Buffalo may be full of Dotty Roses and
Treasure Houses and school crowds, that are heaps
nicer than the Berwick variety!” Mr. Fayre tried to
speak gaily, but at these words Dolly burst into tears
and Dotty followed suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family left the table, and though they tried to
have calm and general conversation the effort was
vain, and very soon the Two D’s went off up-stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went to Dolly’s pretty bedroom, and here
their woe broke out afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” wailed Dolly, “I can’t leave this room, this
pretty, sweet, lovely room, and go to old Buffalo, to
sleep in an attic with rats gnawing me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why would you do that?” and Dotty stopped
midway of a sob to understand this dire prognostication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s as bad as that, whatever it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if your father gets more money, more salary,
you know, maybe you’ll have a grand house, like the
Forbeses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want a grand house. If it’s in Buffalo at
all, I’d just as lieve have the ratty attic as anything
else!” and Dolly renewed her weeping. She rocked
her plump body back and forth in paroxysms of woe,
and wailed out new horrors as they came to her distorted
imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> know the sort of girls they’ll have there. All
wearing shirtwaists and old ribbon bands round their
foreheads! Oh, I know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” and Dotty’s admiration rose
at these strange revelations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I sort of see them, the horrid bunch! I hate
to see girls of our age in shirtwaists, and I <span class='it'>know</span>
they’ll all have them. And the boys will be horrid,
too. Not nice, like our brothers and Tad and Tod,
but all sort of outgrown!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! Buffalo must be an awful place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t only Buffalo, it’s <span class='it'>any</span> place in the United
States, except Berwick. Don’t you see it, Dotty?
Don’t you <span class='it'>know</span> it must be so? And if not just as
I’ve described, it’s something equally worse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose so,” returned Dotty, awed by this
instinctive knowledge of Dolly’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got to go, all the same. So I’ve got to
make up my mind to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t go, and you shan’t make up your mind
to it! I won’t have it. Say, Doll, how about this?
If you do go,—you visit me six months every year,
and I’ll visit you six months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; if I go, I shall give you up entirely, and get
a new chum up there. I can’t have my most intimate
friend a million miles away. And you know our
people wouldn’t agree to that six months business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get a new chum! Dorinda Fayre, I think
you’re the most awful girl I ever saw! I believe you
<span class='it'>want</span> to go to your horrid old Buffalo, and have a girl
with a shirtwaist on, for your intimate friend, and a
band around her forehead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hush up, Dotty! I didn’t mean that, and
you know it! But I’m beside myself, I don’t know
what I’m saying!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the two girls gave way to such desperate
and uncontrollable sobbing, that Trudy heard
them and came to their room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly! Dolly!” she exclaimed. “Oh, you poor
little girl! Don’t cry so, darling. Try to stop,—you’ll
make yourself ill. Dotty, be quiet, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trudy’s soft voice calmed the turbulent ones a
little, and she went on talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Dollykins. I don’t want to leave Berwick,
either. I have lots of friends here—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And beaux,” put in Dotty, suddenly realising
Trudy’s trials, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Trudy agreed, smiling, “and beaux. But
probably beaux grow in Buffalo, and friends of other
sorts too. Now, I don’t in the least undervalue what
it means to you two girls to part, but, Dolly, it can’t
be helped. Father has to go. Now, oughtn’t we to
help him, by unselfishly forgetting our wishes, and
going cheerfully? That’s the only way we can help
Dad, and I think it’s our duty to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is,” sobbed Dolly, “but I always <span class='it'>did</span>
hate to do my duty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you always do it,” and Trudy smiled at her
little sister. “I’ve never known you to shirk a duty
because you hated to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I never had such a big, horrid, awful bad
duty before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and that’s all the more reason why you must
meet this one bravely. Now, don’t think any more
about the whole thing to-night. Go to bed and to
sleep, and to-morrow things will look brighter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls both felt sure they would lie awake all
night, but so exhausted were they by their strenuous
grief, they fell asleep before they knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly woke early in the dawn of morning, and
she lay there in her pretty green room, thinking it
out. And somehow, her thinking cheered her, for at
rising time, Dotty awoke to see a smiling Dolly bending
over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, old sleepyhead! Get your eyes open,
and rise to greet the morn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty rubbed her half-open black eyes, and strove
to remember what was the matter after all. Then it
all came back to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buffalo!” she said, sitting up in bed. “Buff-a-lo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind Buffalo,” and Dolly kept on smiling.
“You wake up, and get yourself up into Berwick.
And if you’ll be a good girl, some day I’ll tell you
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been thinking it out!” exclaimed Dotty.
“I know you! Don’t deny it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I’ve been thinking it out. But don’t you
tell anybody that I have. You get dressed, instanter!
Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty heard, and obeyed, and soon two calm, serene
girls were on their way down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject was not mentioned at the table. The
elders purposely avoided it, and the Two D’s had no
desire to discuss it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only as she was starting for school, that
Dolly said to her mother, with a quivering lip, “Mumsie—when—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In about a month, dear,” said Mrs. Fayre, kissing
the trembling mouth. “Don’t begin to think
about it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two D’s started off in silence. After a block
or so, Dotty said, “Shall you tell the girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dolly, shortly. “Don’t mention it,
Dot. This afternoon in the house, I’ll tell you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty could scarcely wait till afternoon, and then
when that time arrived, Dolly decreed that they
should learn their lessons first, before she told the
“something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting terribly good!” grumbled Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it. I’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to be. Perhaps <span class='it'>then</span> I’ll get
something I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two studied like everything, until they both
declared they really knew all the next day’s lessons.
They even heard each other some of the very hardest
ones, and then, they sat down together before the
fire for the “something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” said Dolly, soberly. “I’m going to
get Father let off from that transfer to Buffalo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t,” said Dotty, with an air of calm conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I can’t, but I’m going to all the same.
Father doesn’t want to go, neither does Mother.
Nor Trudy; nor me. So why should we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause your father is sent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s just it. But I’m going to get him
unsent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amend the Constitution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just about that. Now, look here, Dot: Who is
sending Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Forbes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he is. He’s Father’s boss. Now, who
is Mr. Forbes’ boss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The president of the railroad, I s’pose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Mr. Forbes is bossed and ruled and
absolutely commanded by—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. He worships and idolises his
motherless girl. And, listen, now; through Bernice
I’m going to get Father repealed,—or whatever you
call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, whether I can or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will your father like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t know, till it’s all over. And if I fail,
which I won’t, he need never know. I’ve thought it
out, and it isn’t wrong; there isn’t a wrong thing
about it. Bernice can make her father do anything
in the world she wants to. I know that. So she can
get him to change his mind about my father, if I can
persuade her to do it. I mean, if I can persuade her
to persuade her father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a fine scheme, Dollops, but I can’t seem to
see it succeeding. Bernice can make her father do
anything she wants for herself, but this is different.
Why should she bother her father for your father’s
sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” and Dolly looked uncertain; “but
I’m going to try to make her do it, and sumpum tells
me I shall conquer in the fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked so jubilant, so already victorious,
that Dotty hadn’t the heart to express further doubt.
And too, Dotty had great faith in Dolly’s powers of
success when she set to work in earnest. And she
surely was very much in earnest now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going to tell Trudy or your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; nobody at all but you. Maybe I’ll tell Bert,
when he comes home for Thanksgiving. He could
help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> can help you! I mean, I will, if you’ll tell me
what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed you can help me, Dot. I couldn’t do it
at all without your help. See here, you don’t understand
yet. If Bernice makes her father do this thing,
it’ll be because she herself wants me to stay in Berwick.
And here’s why. Because,—if Bernice does
what I want her to, I’m going to make her the most
popular girl in town!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DOLLY AND BERNICE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dolly</span> went alone to see Bernice. She had wanted
Dotty with her for aid and sympathy, but on thinking
it over, she decided it would be better to go alone
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forbes house was impressive, the man who
opened the door to Dolly’s ring was awe-inspiring, but
of these things Dolly was not afraid. Her fear was
that she would not be able to present in the most persuasive
way, the strange matter on which she had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bernice came into the reception room, she
found Dolly so deep in thought she scarcely heard
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Dolly Fayre,” said the hostess, looking at
her inquiringly. “What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never could guess,” returned Dolly, not resenting
this somewhat ungracious greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I can, you want to beg some money for
some High School performance, or else you want me
to be on some rubbishy old committee. You never
came here just because you wanted to see me,—myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This frightened Dolly, for it struck perilously near
the truth. But she plunged boldly in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not far out, Bernice, and yet it’s nothing
about school. Can any one hear us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but I’ll shut this door. Now, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice’s curiosity was roused by Dolly’s air of repressed
excitement, and her very evident embarrassment.
At least, something unusual was coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice,” she began, “you know my father is in
the employ of your father’s railroad. My father is
in the freight department—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know it. What of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your father has ordered my father to be
transferred to Buffalo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly, I don’t want you to go to Buffalo.
Why, you’re the only friend I have in Berwick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is the point, Bernice. You ought to
have more friends in Berwick. With your home and
everything, you ought to be the most popular girl in
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not!” and Bernice laughed grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s partly your own fault, and partly not.
Now, if you’ll persuade your father to retract that
order and let my father stay in Berwick, I’ll make you
popular,—I will honest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s eyes beamed with earnestness. Her plea
was out, now it was to follow it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that sounds crazy,” she went on, “but
think a minute, Bernice. Your father and mine are
splendid business men, so perhaps we inherit their
business talent. So let’s make a business deal. If I
can make good, and put you in the front ranks of our
crowd, will you try to coax your father to do what I
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dolly Fayre, what an idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it. But I don’t want to leave Berwick,
none of us do, and yet, we’ll have to go, unless your
father changes the orders. I’d ask him myself, only
I know he wouldn’t listen to me, but he would to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does your father know you’re doing this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy, no! I wouldn’t have him know it for the
world! It isn’t wrong, Bernice, and it isn’t underhanded
or anything like that. You know yourself,
how the railroad men are ordered here and there.
Now it seems to me some one else might as well be
sent to Buffalo, and my father left in the New York
office, where he is now. Don’t you think so? If
only your father will agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='make'></a></p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“I’ll make you popular,—I will honest!”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked very pleading. Her little face looked
up into Bernice’s with a wistful, hopeful smile. Her
hands were clasped in the intensity of her feeling,
and her voice quivered as she made her plea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice looked at her. “I don’t know why I
should do this for you, Dolly Fayre,” she said, at
last. “You’re the most popular girl in Berwick, you
and Dotty Rose. Now, if you go away, I’ll stand a
better chance of getting in your crowd, in your place,
than if you stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly hadn’t thought of this. Nor did it strike
her at the moment what a selfish and self-seeking
spirit Bernice showed. She knit her brows as she
thought deeply what to say next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Bernice went on, “I’ve always wanted
to be in your set. It’s the nicest set of all. And
when I was in Grammar School of course I couldn’t,
but now we’re all in High, I want to be one of you.
And I’ll do anything I can to get there. But I think
I’d stand a better chance with you away. Then I’d
be friends with Dotty Rose in your place, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked aghast. Such presumption! But
the absurdity of the idea brought her to her senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much you wouldn’t, Bernie!” she said.
“Dot is willing to do a lot for you if I stay here.
But she knows I’m saying all this to you, and if you
don’t help me about Father’s position with the road,
you can just bet Dotty Rose won’t have anything to
do with you, nor will any one else in our set!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Dolly, isn’t this what the boys call a
‘hold-up’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly laughed. “It did sound like that, but listen,
Bernice. It’s a straight proposition. You want to
be in our set, really in it and of it. Well, I’ll see to
it that you get there, if you’ll coax your father to let
my father stay here. That’s all, and I don’t think
it’s mean or hold-uppish. I think it’s a fair deal between
us. I don’t know what my father would say if
he knew I asked you, but even though he might think
it undignified or silly, he couldn’t say it was really
wrong. Now, could he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” agreed Bernice, “there’s nothing wrong
about it. But can you do your part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know I could. I can make Dad do anything.
He spoils me,—and he’d move to Kamchatka
if I wanted to, or send anybody else there if I
said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I knew he was like that. It’s a shame, Bernie,
with all your lovely home and privileges and
everything, that you’re not top of the heap here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not. And I’m not at all sure, Dolly
Fayre, that you can help to put me anywhere near the
top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How? By making the girls come to see me? Or
by forcing the boys to dance with me? I know of
your efforts in those directions, and don’t you s’pose
they make me feel cheap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice, I don’t wonder. And I’m glad you
spoke like that. No, I don’t mean to do it that way,—not
entirely. But if we go into this bargain, you
and I, it must be a real bargain, and you must help,—not
hinder any part of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly, I’d only be too glad to help. If I
could be popular,—I don’t mean actually top of the
heap, but just liked by the crowd, I’d be so glad.
And if you could help bring it about, I’d make father
do what you want. I know I could, But, I won’t
do it unless you do what you say you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Bernice,” and Dolly looked thoughtful.
“But, you see, if Dad’s orders are changed, I suppose
it ought to be done at once. And I can’t do my part
all in a jiffy, it will naturally take a little time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see that. When does your father expect
to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In about a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be the middle of December. S’pose I get
Father to postpone the date till, say, after Christmas.
The first of the year they often make changes.
That’ll give you nearly two months, and if things are
working all right by then, I can easily make Father
let you stay here. Why, if I told him I wanted you
here in Berwick, he’d make any arrangements to keep
you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do it now!” and Dolly’s eyes danced at this
easy settlement of the whole matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nixy! You haven’t done a thing yet! I don’t
want to be mean about this, but—well, you know
what I <span class='it'>do</span> want and it’s up to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Bernice. Will you ask your father,
to-night, to put off Dad’s transfer till after the holidays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will, and he’ll do it. Now, what are you
going to do first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First of all, I’m going to talk to you like a Dutch
uncle!” Dolly’s eyes were dancing now. Her aim
was accomplished, at least, in part, and her well
thought out campaign was about to be begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Bernice, all I can do will not count at all
unless <span class='it'>you</span> do something to help along. And what
you’ve got to do, is to change your way with ’em.
Now, wait a minute. You’re pretty and bright and
you have lovely clothes and all that, but you go
around with a chip on your shoulder! Yes, you do,
and it upsets your whole apple-cart! Now, you’ve
just simply <span class='it'>got</span> to be sunny and sweet and if you think
you see little slights or mean things, swallow them
and keep on smiling. I know that sounds hard, even
sounds silly, but that’s all there is to it. You’ve got
to break down that sort of barrier you’ve built up
around you. Do you know what they say about
you? They say you’re stuck-up. That’s an awful
thing in our crowd. We don’t like stuck-up people.
You’re so rich, you see, so much richer than any of
the rest of us, that we feel sort of shy of you, unless
you come down to our level. I mean our level as to
grandeur and style and those things. We don’t care
if you have silk dresses when we have gingham, if you
don’t rub it in. Oh, <span class='it'>don’t</span> you see what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know as I do, Dolly,” and Bernice looked
very serious. “But I begin to, and I do believe I
can learn. But it’s so hard when everybody turns
the cold shoulder, and nobody wants to speak to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s so much your own fault! Have you ever
tried, real hard, to be nice to any of the girls? Real
up and down <span class='it'>nice</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ve been too busy paying them back for the
snubs they gave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it! And they only snubbed you because
they thought you were snubbing them. Oh, I
know all about it, Bernice. Don’t you s’pose I’ve
heard them talk you over? And the boys. They say
you’re a pretty girl and a good dancer, but—well,
I’m going to tell you right out, for I believe it will
help you,—they call you a lemon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do, do they? Then I don’t want anything
to do with them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you do! Now, hold on; they call you that,
’cause you <span class='it'>are</span> lemony to them! You know yourself
that you snip and snap the boys awfully. They
won’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Dolly, I haven’t the sweet sunny disposition
that you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get it! You can, if you want to. Good
gracious, Bernice, if you <span class='it'>want</span> to be popular and have
a good time, isn’t it just too easy to quit being a sour
old lemon and work up an amiable manner? Anybody
would think I was asking you to do something
hard! Why, it’s easier to be pleasant than not, if
you only think so! Now, that’s <span class='it'>part</span> of your part.
Next, you must invite people here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give a party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you like. I meant ask just a few at a
time. But it would be a good scheme to start in with
quite a party. Not too gorgeous,—but a nice, <span class='it'>right</span>
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be my birthday week after next, I might
have it then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing! You do that, and let me help
plan your party. You mustn’t have a grand ball,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do just as you say, Dolly,” replied Bernice,
meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” and Dolly laughed. “This is like
planning a campaign, and I s’pose it’s sort of foolish
for girls of our age, but you’re in wrong, and if I can
set you right, I’m only too glad to. And I <span class='it'>can</span>, if
you’ll do as I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m jolly <span class='it'>glad</span> to do as you say! But will the
crowd come to my party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course they will. I’ll make ’em. Now, wait, I
know you don’t like to have them come ’cause they’re
made to, but it’s got to be that way at first, and then
it’s up to you to make it so pleasant they’ll want to
come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But seems to me <span class='it'>I’m</span> doing most of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s the way it seems to you, does it? <span class='it'>Does
it!</span> Well, I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but you
<span class='it'>try</span> it without me, and see where you bring up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was a little annoyed at Bernice’s readiness to
accept her advices and ignore the very real help that
Dolly was able and willing to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Dolly. I sort of forgot myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you try to remember yourself! And remember
too, that while I want you to be one of us,
at the same time, I’m bothering about you for the
reason I told you when I first came here. I’m not
doing it for your sake, but for my own. And,
another thing. I want to stay in Berwick mostly,
because Dotty Rose is here, and she and I are intimate
friends and always will be. She’s ready and
glad to help us in this scheme, but it’s because she
wants to keep me here in Berwick. So, Bernice
Forbes, don’t you try to come between Dot and me,
for it won’t do a bit of good and it will do you a lot
of harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t, honest, Dolly. But does Dotty know all
about your plan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every bit. And I tell you, Bernie, if Dot and I
set out to make you have a good time, you’ll <span class='it'>have</span> it,
and that’s all there is about that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you, and I’m glad you’re so outspoken,
Dolly. Now, honest, I’m going to try, but you don’t
know how hard it is to be nice to those girls when they
turn aside and whisper to each other about me and
all things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t do that, Bernice, if you act differently
toward them. Now, look here. You talk over
your party with your father and if he says you can
have it, get your invitations out soon. My brother
and Dot’s will be home for Thanksgiving,—when is
your birthday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The 30th of November.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! They’ll be here then. Well, you ask your
father about your party,—and—about that other
matter, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will, to-night. And he’ll say yes to both.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BROTHERS AND FUDGE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a few days later that Mr. Fayre announced to
his family the news that his transfer of locality had
been postponed until after the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you won’t have to go at all, Father,”
said Trudy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” agreed Mr. Fayre. “These matters
are uncertain. I should be glad not to leave
Berwick, for I like my New York business, and my
suburban home; but what is to be will be, whether
it ever comes to pass or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was one of Mr. Fayre’s favourite nonsense
speeches and always made the girls laugh. Dolly
laughed now, perhaps a little more than the occasion
demanded, for she knew a small joke of her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty, too, controlled her smiles discreetly and as
the subject was lightly passed over, no one suspected
that the postponement was due to Dolly’s endeavours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice Forbes is going to have a party,” Dolly
said, after a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” said Mrs. Fayre, interestedly.
“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the thirtieth. It’s her birthday. I ’spect it
will be a lovely party. Can I have a new frock,
Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I think so. You need one more new party
dress this winter, and you may as well have it for that
occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought Bernice wasn’t much liked by your
crowd,” said Trudy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she isn’t a favourite,” said Dolly, slowly,
“but I think she’s better liked than she used to be.
Anyway, everybody’ll be glad to go to her party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Trudy, “and then talk about her
afterward! I think that’s mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do too,” chimed in Dotty. “But Bernice is
nicer than she used to be, more pleasant, you know.
And maybe there won’t be anything to say about her
party, except nice things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll probably have a brass band and supper
from New York,” laughed Trudy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I want you to be nice to her, Dolly,” said
Mr. Fayre. “Mr. Forbes has been exceedingly kind
to me of late, and if you can do anything for his
motherless girl, you do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dad,” said Dolly, meekly, though her heart
was singing for joy that she was already carrying
out her father’s wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why I thought Mr. Forbes was an awful strict,
stern man,” said Trudy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is,” returned her father. “And he’s a just
and particular man, in his business relations, as, of
course, he ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you ask him, Father, not to let us go
away from Berwick?” suggested Dolly, timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, no, child. I wouldn’t dream of such a
thing! If he says go, I must go. But he spoke to-day
as if the matter were still in abeyance—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind your geography, Dollums. You
wouldn’t find abeyance in any Christian country. I
mean he spoke as if my going away is still uncertain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Well, I’m glad of it. Every day here
counts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Bernice’s birthday party came off Dolly
had much to do. And Dotty ably aided and abetted
her plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lost no opportunity to hint to the girls and
boys of Bernice’s good traits. They even said to
some, that she had been misunderstood and enlisted
their sympathies for the new candidate for favours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice herself tried hard to do her part. Naturally
shy, hers was the disposition that takes quick
offence at a seeming slight, and supersensitive to such,
she often felt like returning a haughty stare. But
she remembered Dolly’s instructions, and managed
fairly well to control her quick temper, and overlook
many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before the party Bob Rose and Bert
Fayre came home from their school for the Thanksgiving
vacation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great rejoicing was in the two families at this
event. Dotty had returned home, Genie being all well
again, and Treasure House was the daily meeting
place of the quartette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My stars! girls, but this is fine!” declared Bert,
as the Two D’s showed off their possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet it is!” chimed in Bob, as he paraded
round the House, taking in all its glories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the day of their return, they hadn’t been in
town ten minutes before they were rushed over to the
wonderful Treasure House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And catch onto the dinky kitchen business! Can
you cook, oh, Treasure ladies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some,” said Dolly, smiling at the recollection of
the feast that failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! We’ll show you how. Say we begin
now. What you got on hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wait, Bert! don’t upset things!” cried Dolly,
in dismay, for her brother was ruthlessly rummaging
in the cupboard for goodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unhand me, villain!” and Bert shook off Dolly’s
restraining hand. “I seek what I seek!” and with
a flourish he brought out a package of chocolate and
the sugar bowl. “Fee fi fo fum, I smell the scent of
Fudgerum. Go to it, Dollops! See how quick you
can turn out a panful!” Bert took out his watch as
if to time her. “One, two three! Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falling into the spirit of the thing, Dolly whisked
out a sauce-pan and long-handled spoon, while twice
as quickly, Dotty seized a knife and began to shave
off the chocolate. Fudge was a thing they <span class='it'>could</span>
make, with no chance of failure, so the two worked
smoothly together, and in an incredibly short time,
the delectable compound was cooling, to be cut into
squares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the right sort of sisters for a chap to
have,” said Bob, looking admiringly at the two smiling,
flushed faces before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re two pretty good brothers,” Dotty flashed
back, and Bert remarked. “Cut out the taffy, and
look after the fudge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they marked it off in squares and diamonds, and
the impatient boys began on it at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we’ll bring home some chaps for the Christmas
Vake, hey, Bob?” and Bert nodded at his chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a go. But not many, for this house has
all the modern improvements, except size, it seems to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it holds quite a good many,” Dolly said;
“we’ve had sixteen here at a time and it wasn’t so
awfully crowded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. We’ll bring Chalk and Cheese, eh,
Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Give me another piece of fudge, Dollums.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be very exceedingly ill,” remarked Dolly,
gravely, as she handed her brother the plate. “Now,
see here, Bert, and you, too, Bob, I’ve got you sweetened
up, I want to tell you something. To ask you
something, rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clever Dolly! First fudge, then demands.
Well, go ahead. To the half of my kingdom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, listen, I’m serious. It’s about Bernice
Forbes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t!” and Bert grinned. “I know the
fair Bernie! None for this citizen, thank you!
What you want? Me to take her to a party, I’ll bet.
Well, you lose! See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Bert, be quiet,” and Dolly gave him a pleading
glance. “Don’t jump at things so. Be still a
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” put in Bob. “My chum, at his sister’s
request, will now be mum. But I’ll take the
floor. I hereby assent that Us Two, being for the
moment in a position to grace the fair town of Berwick
by our gracious presence, utterly decline to
spoil our all too short stay in these parts, by so
much as an allusion to the impossible Forbes damsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you <span class='it'>must</span> listen,” and Dolly looked so
honestly distressed, that the boys woke up to the fact
that she was serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away, then,” said Bert, “but cut it short.
What’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this,” burst out Dotty, for Dolly couldn’t
seem to find the right words. “We’re booming Bernice.
And you two have got to help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Help!” cried Bert, faintly. “Do I get
you aright?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do!” and Dotty wagged her black head, vigorously.
“You sure do! Now, the situation is
this—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me tell,” said Dolly, who had recovered her
nerve. “For reasons of my own, which I will not
explain at present, but which affect you, Bert, as
much as me, it is necessary that we make Bernice popular—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” exploded Bob. “Bernice popular!
Oh, Jiminy Crickets! that’s a good one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, popular,” repeated Dolly, severely. “And
if it seems so difficult to you, then there will be all the
more glory in accomplishing it. Now, don’t stop
to argue; just realise that we’re going to do it. Look
on it as a stunt, to be wrastled somehow, and—and
chip in and help us. Are you wid us or agin us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was standing now, and flung out her arms like
an importunate orator, pleading for the sympathies
of his audience. A determined fire shone in her deep
blue eyes, a determined smile curved her red lips, and
as she paused for a reply, Bob shouted, “To the last
ditch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you!” and Dolly thanked him with a
beaming smile. “Now, Bert, of course you’re in it,
too. So here’s the game. We four are to do all we
can, in a clever and quiet way, to make Bernice
Forbes’ party a howling success, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Told you it was a party!” growled Bert.
“Hate parties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t hate parties. You love ’em. And
this party is next Tuesday, and if you two boys don’t
go in and win,—for me—you’re no good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it to you, Doll?” asked her brother, detecting
the earnest note in Dolly’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means a lot, Bert,” and Dolly’s voice shook a
little. “But never mind that now. You two just do
as we girls—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ours not to reason why,” exclaimed Bob; “ours
but to do or die! and we’ll do anything or anybody
you say. Now, as to details, what is our special rôle
at this party racket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this,” said Dotty. “To push up Bernice’s
stock! Be awfully nice to her yourselves. Make
the other boys be nice to her, too. See that she has a
partner for every dance and a good time at every
game,—or whatever they have. Hover round her at
supper time, and in general make her think she’s It!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Sweet Sister, what you say, goes! But
you’ve given us a pretty large order! You know the
lady, I take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you don’t. At least, you don’t know
that she’s a heap nicer than she used to be. Also,
you don’t know what a great big whopping reason
there is for all this. If you did, you’d—why, you’d
fly over there at once, there’d be no holding you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can’t we know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not just now,” said Dolly, looking mysterious.
“Some day, if you’re good, I may tell you. Till
then, you must work in the dark. Oh, you <span class='it'>are</span> good
boys! I knew I could depend on you! Have some
more fudge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh thank you <span class='it'>so</span> much! Say, if we promise to
do all and more than mortal can ask to further that
crazy project of yours, can we drop the subject for
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but remember you’ve promised,” and Dotty
shook her finger at the two jolly boys, who were willing
to please their sisters, but who took little interest
in Bernice Forbes and her success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” observed Bob, as they returned to
discussion of Treasure House, “that this is too good
a piece of property for two simple girls! Why, it’s
worthy of boy occupants. Want to rent it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No-sir-ee, Bob!” laughed Dolly. “We’ve been
weeks getting it into shape, and fixed just exactly as
we want it, and we don’t propose to have a lot of boys
rampoosing all over it. You are invited to inspect it,—and
then I don’t know as you’ll be asked again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I like that! Why, we supposed you’d give
us the freedom of it while we’re at home, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we won’t lock you out, except when we’re
studying,” said Dotty. “But there won’t be much
studying while you’re home, for it’s our vacation too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a rap sounded on the brass knocker of
Treasure House, and Bob flung open the door to
admit the three Rawlins and two Browns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo,” cried Tad and Tod together; “when did
you fellows get home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to-day,” answered Bert, as they all said
hullo to each other and then found seats for themselves
on chairs, window-boxes or floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then a general chattering broke loose. Everybody
talked at once, and Bob and Bert were welcomed
back like long lost brothers. But soon the
boys all had their heads together, telling of Clayton’s
wonderful new football, and the girls had
grouped themselves on the other side of the room
and were eagerly discussing Bernice’s party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going, now, Doll,” shouted Bert. “Going
over to Clayt’s. All us fellows. Don’t weep, ladies,
but we <span class='it'>must</span> leave you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dotty. “We can spare you.
Of course, we just hate to have you go, but if you
must—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll come back. But it’s too great a day
to stay inside. You girls had better go out for a
run yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we will,” said Dolly. “But wait a minute,
boys. I want to ask you something. Won’t
you each promise to dance twice with Bernice at her
party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, gracious! Bernice again!” and Tod
Brown pretended to fall in a faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, again and yet and all the time!” declared
Dolly, laughing at Tod’s ridiculous antics. “Now,
own up, you know you can’t go to her party and not
dance with her—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why go?” demanded Clayton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you’ll go! Wild horses couldn’t keep
you away! But as you’re going, why not be decent
about it, and do the really nice thing? If each of
you will dance twice, and a few others once, she will
have all the partners she wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you her press agent, Dolly? What has
come over you?” asked Tad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind about that. You just do as I
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Tad was pretty apt to do as Dolly said, and
so he bowed and scraped, saying, “What you say
goes. Two is <span class='it'>my</span> number. Hey, fellows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two it is!” sung out Tod, and the rest voiced
agreement. “Now can we go, mum?” begged Tad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, “you’re good boys, and you
may run and play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>are</span> you up to, Dolly?” asked Grace, as
the boys ran off, laughing and jumping about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracie, you know how much I want to make Bernice
more popular. Well, this is my chance, and I
want all you girls to help me. If we take her up and
are nice to her, the boys will do as we tell them, and
the other girls will fall in line, and it will be all right.
But if we fall down on it, the whole plan will drop
through. <span class='it'>Do</span> be <a id='onmy'></a>on my side, won’t you, Grace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wily Dolly knew that Ethel would do whatever
Grace did, and also that Maisie May would agree to
whatever the Rawlinses agreed to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will,” declared Grace. “I think we
haven’t been very nice to Bernice, and I’m ready to
try to be friends with her, if she’ll have it. But,
Dolly, you know she isn’t very easy to be nice to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Grace, but I think we’ll find her better
natured nowadays. Any way, let’s be awful nice
to her at her own party, and try to make it a grand
success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Grace, “I’ll do all <span class='it'>I</span> can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Me</span> too,” said Ethel, and then Dolly was satisfied.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BOOMING BERNICE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dolly</span> hesitated about telling Bert of her plans. She
wanted him to know the importance of the matter,
and yet, she feared he would disapprove of the whole
idea. So she put off telling him, and now the very
day had arrived, and she had a feeling that he must
know before he went to the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was dressed early. She had on her new
frock, and a dainty, pretty affair it was. Made of
white net, it was frilled with many little outstanding
ruffles, edged with blue silk. Tiny garlands of blue
forget-me-nots headed the flounces, and edged the
round neck of the bodice. Her golden curls were
caught back by a pearl barrette and a delicate wreath
of forget-me-nots encircled her head. Dotty’s dress
was just like Dolly’s, with pink rosebuds in place of
the blue flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course the quartette were to go together, but
there was yet nearly half an hour before time to start.
Dolly sat in her room, thinking it out, and at last decided
to tell Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to his room, and found him deeply absorbed
in tying his necktie. She sat down and waited,
silently, being too wise to interrupt the engrossing
performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the bow was completed to the young man’s
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Dolls,” he said, to her reflection in his
mirror. “Here for criticism or commendation?”
and he looked leniently on the pretty new frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither. And we’ve only a few minutes, so, listen,
Bert, I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away,” and the preoccupied boy looked over
a pile of handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly spoke quickly and to the point. She told
him of her bargain with Bernice and all she hoped
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, I couldn’t,—I just <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> leave Berwick
and Dot, so I tried this plan, and I hope,—oh,—I
most <span class='it'>know</span> it will succeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorinda Fayre, you’re a hummer!” was Bert’s
comment, and he sat down on the edge of his bed, and
looked at his sister. “What <span class='it'>do</span> you s’pose dad
would say if he knew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>mustn’t</span> know. But, it isn’t wrong, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, I don’t say it’s wrong, exactly, but it’s—why,
Doll, it’s crazy! That’s what it is, crazy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care how crazy it is, if it works. Why,
Bert, anybody can go to Buffalo as well as for us to
go. And probably the other man wants to go, and
father doesn’t. And I don’t, and Trudy doesn’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Trudy know of your stroke of state?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed. She’d tell, and dad and mother
might put a stop to it. Now, Bert, <span class='it'>you’ll</span> help me,
<span class='it'>won’t</span> you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly had the whip hand, and she knew it. Bert
was very proud of his pretty sister, and as she smiled
winsomely, in all the bravery of her party array, he
hadn’t the heart to refuse her. Moreover, though he
was amazed at her daring project, it seemed to him
possible, owing to Mr. Forbes’ indulgence of his
daughter’s whims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course, Dollops, I’ll do whatever I
can—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you <span class='it'>dear</span> old Bert! I was <span class='it'>so</span> afraid you
wouldn’t! You can do such heaps, you know! Now,
let’s start, and you must just remember every minute
at the party, that you’re booming Bernice. Get the
boys to show her attentions, but <span class='it'>don’t</span> for goodness’
sake, let them know what you’re up to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dollydoodle! Do you think I’m a ninny! Don’t
tell <span class='it'>me</span> how to conduct this publicity campaign! Give
me credit for a grain of sense,—and leave all to
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert waved his hand with a lordly air, and Dolly
felt a great weight lifted from her shoulders. If
Bert took the initiative like that, he was sure to succeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Bob know?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want to tell Bob, if we can help it.
Dotty promised not to tell anybody. Can’t we manage
without letting any more know, than do know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’spect so, Kiddy. Run along, and get your
bonnet and shawl and let’s get at this world-beating
game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly ran away for her wraps with a light heart.
What a <span class='it'>dear</span> Bert was, to be sure!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trudy helped her on with her pretty party cape,
and adjusted a chiffon scarf over the curly head.
Then she kissed her good-bye, and the brother and
sister started forth. They stopped next door for
the Roses, and all went to the Forbes house together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were the first arrivals, which suited Dolly’s
plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house looked very beautiful, decorated as it
was with flowers and palms. In the music room they
could hear a harp and violin being tuned, and then
Bernice herself came smiling, to greet them, arrayed
in a stunning gown of gold-coloured crêpe, embroidered
with poppies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was over elaborate for so young a girl, but it
suited Bernice’s dark hair and clear, olive skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Forbes stood by, pleasant and amiable, but
with a natural stiffness of manner, which he found
it hard to overcome. Mrs. Forbes had been dead
for many years, and Bernice had had little, if any
company, so that Mr. Forbes had drawn more and
more into himself, and had become a sort of hermit.
But this evening, he tried to be sociable, even jovial,
and he succeeded fairly well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two lived alone, save for a small army of
servants. It was Mr. Forbes’ theory that an American
girl is capable of looking after herself, and he
desired no governess or companion for his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Bernice had grown up, with no other mentor
than her own sweet will, for her father never interfered
or advised in household matters. There was a
housekeeper, but she merely ordered the kitchen department,
and had no supervision over Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party would have been far more elaborate,
had Bernice had her own way. But Dolly, not wanting
her protégée to be criticised by the mothers of
the Berwick young people, had persuaded her to keep
it simpler in details than she wanted to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of having plenty of money if you
don’t spend it?” Bernice had demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dolly had not attempted to answer her, but
had merely reminded her that she had promised to
do her part to reach their mutual goal, and that to
abide by Dolly’s decisions would favour their cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there were only three pieces of music instead
of a full orchestra. Only a simple, though fine and
bountiful supper, instead of the gorgeous repast Bernice
would have preferred. And only a proper
amount of floral decoration, instead of a city florist’s
extreme effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the house looked lovely, and the dining-room,
as Dolly flew out to snatch a glance at it, was tastefully
arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully good of you, Mr. Forbes,” said Dolly,
smiling at the rather bewildered-looking man, “to
let us have this pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, not at all,” said the railroad magnate,
rubbing his hands. “Might just as well have
had more. More music, more people, more fal-lals.
I said to Bernie, ‘If you’re doing it, why not do it
up brown?’ But she said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said, ‘This <span class='it'>is</span> brown,’ ” said Dolly, laughing.
“And it is, Mr. Forbes. You know yourself, Bernie
is too young for a real live ball, and that’s what
it would be, if she had it much more grand than this.
How beautiful your house is,” and Dolly looked
around admiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad you think so. Hasn’t been re-decorated or
fixed up since my wife died. Guess I’ll have to furbish
it up a little if Bernie is going to be in gay society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She surely is. You can’t keep such a pretty girl
all to yourself always, Mr. Forbes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I s’pose not—I s’pose not. Well, I want
her to enjoy herself. She’s like her mother. Her
mother was a great one for gaiety. Run along, now,
Miss Dolly, and join your young friends. You
mustn’t be wasting time on an old man like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly smiled at him, and then went over to the
group already forming around Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had a new bee in her bonnet. Nothing
more nor less than to make friends with Mr. Forbes
himself, and if need be, plead with him for her father’s
stay in Berwick. Dolly’s was a single-minded nature.
She had set her heart and mind to this plan
of hers and she bent everything toward her aim.
Buoyed up with hope, she came laughingly toward the
young people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there, Dolly Fayre,” sang out Tad Brown,
“thought you had deserted us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed! I’m helping Bernice receive,—that’s
why I spend my time talking to her father,” and
Dolly laughed whimsically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gay as a butterfly, she smiled and chatted with
everybody, but also kept a strict watch over her
helpers in the game. Nor was she disappointed. In
a moment, she heard Bert and Bob both pleading
with Bernice for the first dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>must</span> give it to me,” said Bert, “ ’cause I’m
Dolly’s pet brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m Dotty’s ditto,” urged Bob. “And besides,
I’m a much better dancer than Bert Fayre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then give it to me out of charity,” said Bert.
“Have pity on a poor hobble-de-hoy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unaccustomed to this flattering style of conversation,
Bernice blushed with pleasure, and grew coquettish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I won’t give it to either of you,” she
smiled. “Maybe it’s already engaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, say not so!” and Bert assumed a tragic
pose. “But if it be, tell me the miscreant who dares
aspire, and let me at him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too,” chimed in Bob. “Oh, surely, certainly
me, too! Let us <span class='it'>both</span> at him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys were so ridiculous that Bernice burst into
laughter, and Mr. Forbes drew nearer to see what it
was all about. Others did too, and the result was
that Bernice was the centre of a jolly group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She finally settled the matter by dividing the first
dance and giving half to each of her suppliants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And each claimed two more dances later on; and
others flocked around asking Bernice for her dance
card, until very shortly, her card was filled, with
several down for extras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice was supremely happy. Only a girl who
has been a wall-flower frequently, can appreciate the
pleasure she felt in being besought for dances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was satisfied with the behaviour of her colleagues.
Not only the boys were doing their part
nobly, but the girls were now and then chatting cordially
with Bernice, and acting as if she were one of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All serene, Dolly?” asked Bob, as he came up to
claim one of his dances with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” and Dolly’s eyes shone. “You’re
a trump, Bob! I thank you a thousand bushels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t so hard. Bernie has improved a lot
since last we met. She isn’t nearly so pettish and
stickery as she used to be. And she’s mighty pretty,
beside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t she! And that dress is stunning on
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather grown-uppish, isn’t it? I like yours and
Dot’s better. But I’m not much on parties, anyhow.
These dance affairs bore me stiff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I thought you liked them. A college boy
ought to be crazy about dances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I s’pose they’re good enough, but I like better
a rollicking picnic, or something outdoorsy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly! You can’t have picnics in winter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can have outdoor sports. There ought
to be skating to-morrow, I think. It’s getting awfully
cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish there would be, I love to skate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. If there is any to-morrow, will you
go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I! Well, I just guess I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But hold on. Say, Dolly, if we go skating, have
we got to lug the Bernice person along?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bob, I’m ashamed of you! Just when I think
I’ve got you well trained, you act up like that! Why,
of <span class='it'>course</span> we have. She’s my chum; and what you do
for her, you do for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, jiminetty! I do hate outsiders. You and
Dot and Bert and Yours Truly make such a jolly
four. Why drag in others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got to be done. Now, don’t whine over it, just
make up your mind to it. Let’s make a skating party
for to-morrow afternoon, of about eight, and then
afterward go back to Treasure House and make fudge
or something like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right on the fudge. But instead of eight,
say four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir! Eight it is, and <span class='it'>I’ll</span> do the inviting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly had found out that Bob’s bark was worse
than his bite. He might growl at the things she
asked him to do, but he did them and did them well.
As for Bert, he was putting things through with a
dash. He not only danced with Bernice, but he
sought her out between dances, and joked and
laughed as he passed her on the dancing floor, and
many times brought her to the attention of others in
a way to win admiration for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At supper time the “crowd” got together in a
corner of the big dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What</span> a table!” exclaimed Tod Brown. “Oh,
what a feast for the gods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make believe we’re little tin gods, and get us
some of it,” suggested Bert, who was seated by Bernice.
“I daren’t leave my seat. It might be
snatched by a less worthy occupant. You do
the foraging act, Tad,—and get some little helpers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were waiters, but the “crowd” often
thought it preferable to have some of their “own
boys” secure viands for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Tad and Clayton Rawlins and Lollie and Joe
started, and soon returned with what Joe called “the
pick of the lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What gorgeous foods!” cried Dolly. “And
I’m starving with hunger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I,” declared Grace. “May I have a tiny
sandwich?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tiny sandwich doesn’t seem to match Grace
Rawlins!” chaffed Joe. “Here’s a plateful, my
girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None too many,” said Grace, good-naturedly.
“Have some of mine, Bernice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost beside herself with joy at being really in
the crowd, Bernice smiled and joked with the rest,
and in their hearts most of them decided she “wasn’t
half-bad after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Celia Ferris was not so willing as the others to
accept Bernice as one of them, and she stood a little
aloof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go for Celia,” thought Dolly, as she
looked the group over, and found most of them acting
in accordance with her orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So finding opportunity, she said to Celia, “Bernice
makes a good hostess, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good nothing!” exclaimed Celia, in a whisper.
“What’s the matter with everybody to rave over her,
all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I think she’s worth raving over,” Dolly
defended. “Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Deed I don’t! And I, for one, won’t toady to
her just ’cause she’s rich and lives in a big house—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Celia,” and Dolly laughed outright; “how
ridiculous! <span class='it'>Do</span> you s’pose, for a minute, that Bert
and Bob are nice to Bernice for any such reasons?
You know better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know as they are,—but you and Dotty
Rose are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we’re not. I like Bernice for far other reasons
than that. And you’d better, too, unless you
want to be in the minority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with this, Dolly turned on her heel and left
the astonished Celia with something to think about.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BERT AND THE BARGAIN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> day after Bernice’s party everybody went skating.
A lake on the outskirts of Berwick obligingly
froze itself over with a sufficient thickness of ice to
be entirely safe. So the whole of the younger population
put itself on runners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fayres and Roses arrived early in the afternoon.
Encased in warm sweaters and knit caps, they
braved the cold, and were soon swaying along the
glassy surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly and Dotty had decided not to call it a skating
party, but after they tired of the ice, to ask
half a dozen or so to go back with them to Treasure
House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later Bernice came, alone. She wore a new skating
suit of green cloth, fur-trimmed, and a jaunty
green cap with a red feather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Bernice,” said Dolly quickly to Bert.
“You must go and skate with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t do it. I did my duty last night, and I’m
tired of the game. Get somebody else.” Bert
laughed good-naturedly, and skated off with Maisie
May, who had not heard the colloquy of the brother
and sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Bernice, by reason of her good time the night
before, seemed to take it for granted that her star
was in the ascendant. “Here I am!” she cried,
gaily. “Who bids for the honour of the first skate
with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She couldn’t have chosen a worse speech. It was
full of arrogance, and her condescending smile as she
swung her skates in her hand, did not attract the
boys who were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Dotty,” said Joe Collins, “let’s skate
off. I don’t want any Forbes in mine this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty hesitated, for she had promised Dolly to
help her, but Joe urged her away and the two skated
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly went straight to Bernice, and said in a low
tone: “Don’t talk that way, Bernie! You scare
them all off. They won’t stand your putting on
airs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Airs, nothing!” cried Bernice. “Don’t tell <span class='it'>me</span>
how to behave, Dolly Fayre! Hello, there, Tad
Brown. Put on my skates for me, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus summoned, Tad had to obey, and after the
skates were adjusted, Bernice said, “Now, for a
glide,” and perforce Tad skated with her. But he
made a grimace over his shoulder at Dolly, and Bernice
saw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t go with you, you rude thing!” she exclaimed.
“I saw you wink at Dolly Fayre!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Tad exclaimed, “haven’t I a right to
wink if I want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know what you meant, you meant you
didn’t want to skate with me. Come, now, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I did, I wouldn’t tell you so,” said Tad, half-laughing
at Bernice’s angry face. And this so enraged
her, that she turned and left him, and skated
off alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was in despair. Was all her plan to fall
through because Bernice herself couldn’t make good?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matter, Dollsie?” said Lollie Henry, just
arriving, and seeing the woebegone face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lollie, you’re my friend! <span class='it'>Do</span> help me out!
<span class='it'>Please</span> go and skate with Bernice, and be awfully nice
to her, no matter <span class='it'>what</span> she says. Won’t you, Lollie,
please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” said Lollie, looking into the pleading
blue eyes. “What you say, goes. Me to the Bernie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He skated after Bernice, overtook her, and holding
out his hands said, “You’re a dandy skater,
catch on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladly Bernice joined hands, and in a moment they
were gaily skating among the others. Dolly, delighted
at the sight, looked about for somebody to
skate with, herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A laughing face peeped from behind a tree, and
Reggie Stuart came cautiously forth. “Hid from
the other one,” he explained. “Thought you’d
never get her fixed up. Why are <span class='it'>you</span> in charge of
her goings and comings, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause I want to be. Now, you be good, Reg.
If you’re my friend, you’ve got to be Bernice’s, too.
Come on, let’s skate. I’m bothered in my head and
perhaps it will tangle up my feet, but we’ll try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It didn’t; on the contrary, the delightful exercise
soothed Dolly’s wrought-up nerves, and with every
stroke she became more her own gay, merry self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for yourself!” she cried, as Reggie
nearly tripped over a chunk of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I <span class='it'>am</span> a tangle-footed jay! Always getting
in the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! You’re a fine skater! Let’s catch
up to Dot and Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the afternoon wore on, Dolly saw several times
that Bernice was standing alone and neglected. Several
of the boys, at Dolly’s insistence, or at Dotty’s
request, had skated with her, but only for short excursions,
and somehow all the popularity that Bernice
had enjoyed the night before seemed to be fading
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear,” Dolly sighed to herself, “I’m going
to fail, after all. Last night, it was at her house,
so the boys and girls <span class='it'>had</span> to be decent, but they
won’t keep it up, and it’s all Bernie’s fault. I’ve
done all I can. But I <span class='it'>won’t</span> give up! I <span class='it'>can’t</span>! I
must succeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In desperation she flew over to Bob Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bob, please, for my sake, <span class='it'>do</span> go and skate with
Bernice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, Dolly! Why this heart-rending
plea? I’ll do it, if I must, but I’d a lot rather skate
with you. She’s so—so—dressy, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, just <span class='it'>go</span>! And <span class='it'>stay</span>, and keep on
skating with her till somebody else asks her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! That’ll be till—well, off I go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off Bob went, and was so pleasantly polite and
courteous that Bernice had no suspicion that he had
been asked to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” he said, cordially. “May I have the
honour of a glide with the girl in green?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice smiled, and consented gladly. She was a
good skater, and they glided evenly along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great little old lake, isn’t it?” said Bob, as they
flew on. “We haven’t such a good skating place at
school. Only a skinny little river, that hardly ever
freezes solid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before Bernice could respond, they heard
Bob’s name called by a loud voice on shore, and looking
hack, they saw Mr. Rose in his motor-car, beckoning
to Bob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Scuse me just a minute,” said the boy and ran to
see what his father wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully sorry,” he said as he returned, “but
I’ve got to go off with Dad. It’s a special matter,
or I wouldn’t leave you. We must have another
skate together, before I go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wave of his cap, Bob ran off to join his
father, and Bernice was alone again. Again Dolly
came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time she went for Bert, who was skating with
Dotty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bert Fayre,” she began, “you go straight and
skate with Bernie, and you make her have a good
time, and don’t let her know I sent you. Go right
off, and don’t muff it! Do it up <span class='it'>right</span>. I’m about
all in, and this game is going to be too much for
me, unless <span class='it'>somebody</span> helps me and helps me right.
Go on, now,—and Dot and I will skate together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impressed by Dolly’s tense voice and harassed face,
Bert obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, little sister,” he said. “Trust big
buddie to do it up to the queen’s taste. Tra-la-la!”
with a flourishing bow. Bert left the two girls and
skated over to where Bernice stood, looking pettish
and sulky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there, Diana,” greeted Bert; “been waiting
for a chance at you. What did you do with Bob?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His father came, and he had to go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good boy to obey his daddy, and thereby let me
have his place. Come for a whirl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to?” and Bernice looked coquettish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Been living all my life for this moment!
Wow! You’re a peach of a skater! All crosspatch
girls are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” and Bernice stopped short, thinking she
could not have heard aright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard me,” said Bert, carelessly. “Why?
Didn’t you know you’re crosspatch? It’s written in
every line of your expressive face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert was laughing so pleasantly, that Bernice was
bewildered. Did he mean what he was saying? Was
it a joke? Or what was the explanation?</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='iknow'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i246.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>“I know all about your bargain with my sister.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Needn’t get huffy,” Bert went on. “I s’pose
you can’t help it. Pity, too, such a nice girl spoiled
by bad temper! Well, I don’t mind; I like crosspatches
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re very rude!” and Bernice tried to
draw her hand from his. “I don’t want to skate
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you do, too. I’m one of the nicest boys
here. And you’ve no reason to get mad. I’m only
telling you the truth. And of course you want to
be cross, or you wouldn’t be so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m <span class='it'>not</span> cross!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>no</span>! No! You’re our little ray o’ sunshine!
Oh, <span class='it'>yes</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, Bernice was in a towering
rage. She had never before been spoken to like this,
and she didn’t know what to make of it. But it was
difficult to be angry at a boy who grinned in a most
friendly manner, even while he said such impertinent
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, look here, Bernice Forbes,” Bert went on,
as they skated smoothly along, “I know all about
your bargain with my sister. I think it’s a crazy
idea, but all the same, I think it’s a fair deal. And
I want to help. But Dolly doesn’t need help, <span class='it'>she</span>
can do all she has set out to do. So, I want to help
you. Mayn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert’s frank, boyish face was very wheedlesome,
and as he smiled at Bernice, she saw he was in earnest
and in a kindly, whole-souled way meant just what
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re the strangest boy I ever saw!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, let it go at that. But let’s have this
thing out. Are you willing to let me help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help me what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s pretend. You know what I mean, or,—if
you want it in plain English,—help you to be
one of the most popular girls in Berwick, which is
what you <span class='it'>ought</span> to be, and <span class='it'>can</span> be as well as not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t. I’ve tried—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, you haven’t tried. At least, not in
the right way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the right way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you ask that. Then, you are willing to let
me help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am, if you can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, first of all, you must remove that chip
from your shoulder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert spoke so earnestly, that Bernice involuntarily
glanced at her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s there,” said Bert gravely. “You see,
Bernie, you think the world owes you a living, and
the world is not sure that it does. So you’ve got
to earn that living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Earn my own living! Why, my father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, can’t you understand parables? I mean,
you think Berwick owes you a liking, then, and really,
you’ve got to <span class='it'>make</span> Berwick like you. Berwick, in
this case, meaning the dozen or so boys and girls of
our set.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, if you know so much, how am I to
make them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, as I said, dislodge that very large and
elegant chip that adorns your shoulder,—meaning,
don’t feel grouchy toward people because they don’t
run and fall on your neck as you approach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Bert Fayre, you’re awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I’m awful, but I’ve simply got to put it
to you straight. I know what Dolly’s after, and I
know you can give it to her, and yet, it will all be of no
use if you don’t play up yourself. You will, Bernice,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will. But I don’t know how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you <span class='it'>do</span> know how, only you find it hard.
All you have to do to make people like you and want
to be with you, is to like them and be nice to them.
You can’t just sit around accepting,—you must
give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smiles, kindliness, gaiety, fun, nonsense, real true
understanding, and all the things that go to make a
tiptop girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, like my sister, and Dot Rose and Maisie
May, and the Rawlins girls—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody except me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you see it that way, then act so you’ll
put yourself in the bunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to try, Bert. You’ve given me a new
idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; you thought Dolly could do it all, and
you just sit back and take favours as they drop in
your lap. Well, probably you can do that some
day, but first, you’ve got to make good. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice had only a chance for an answering smile,
when Dolly called to them to come on, as they were
going home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and Bernice turned back, and joined the others,
took off their skates and started homeward.
The crowd separated to take their various ways, and
the two D’s asked a few to go to Treasure House
with them for a fudge feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better come,” said Bert to Bernice. “The girls
make ripping fudge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And very gladly Bernice went along. Dolly had
not meant to ask her, for she was wearied with her
afternoon’s efforts and a little discouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she seconded Bert’s invitation, and with the
two Browns and Lollie, they all went to Treasure
House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys built up a roaring log fire while the girls
went to the kitchenette to make the cherished fudge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me help,” said Bernice in such a gay, sunshiny
voice that Dotty looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Bernie,” she said, meeting her half
way. “You shave off this chocolate, and Doll and
I will fix the other ingrejunts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All three worked with a will, and in the shortest
possible time consistent with good fudge, the candy
was ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sim-pul-ly delicious!” exclaimed Lollie, rolling
his eyes up. “Who made it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of us,” said Bernice, “but mostly Dolly and
Dotty. I only helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the help part that tastes so good, then,”
and Bert smiled at her, with a knowing nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This delighted Bernice, and expanding under the
warmth of Bert’s approval, she tried her best to be
entertaining, and in gayest mood she chaffed and
joked until she was really the centre of attraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must go home now,” she said, at last. “I just
hate to leave, but Dad gets home at six, and he always
wants to see his little girl there waiting for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Bernie, if you must go,” said Dotty,
and then all were surprised to hear Bert say, “I’ll
walk around with you,—it’s sort of dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Bernice in the nicest kind of
way, and they started off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dolly, as the other boys had gone
too, “Bert <span class='it'>is</span> an old trump, after all. Bob was,
too, only he was called off just at the wrong time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll do his part yet,” and Dotty wagged her
head assuredly; “I’ll make him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, Dot,” said Dolly.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ELECTION</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> cannot be denied that Dolly had a hard task before
her in what she had undertaken. When Bert
and Bob went back to school, she lost two very
efficient helpers, and her own efforts seemed to be
unavailing. Dotty was willing enough to help, but
she was so quick-tempered herself, she could do little
for or with Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bernice, herself, was most aggravating. Just
as Dolly would get the girls and boys ready to do
something nice for her, Bernice would break out in
a pettish mood, or pick some silly quarrel, that interfered
with all plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s just this about it,” Dolly said to Dotty,
one afternoon, as they sat in Treasure House, talking
it over, “we’ve got to do something desperate
to boom Bernie, or I’ve got to give it all up, and then
she won’t ask her father to let us stay, and we’ll have
to go away from Berwick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears flooded her blue eyes, and rolled down
her cheeks. Dotty, overcome by the thought, burst
into violent weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t go, Dollyrinda! I won’t let you! I
can’t spare you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s nonsense, Dot. We’ve got to go, if
my plan falls through. And it has about fallen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you’d speak to Mr. Forbes, himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but I can’t do that. I’ve thought it
out, and I believe that would be wrong, because I
know Dad wouldn’t like me to do it. But to bargain
with Bernice is different. Just two girls, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s try some new plan. I’ll tell you,
Doll, let’s make her Class President. We vote next
week, you know. We’ll electioneer,—or whatever
you call it,—and make the whole class vote for
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Make the whole class vote for her! I
think I see them doing that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can get a majority, anyway. You and
I can coax or bribe lots of the girls, and Tod and
Tad will help round up the boys on our side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” and Dolly brightened a little, “maybe
we could do that. Bernie is so uncertain, lately.
One day she’s as sweet as pie, and then she’s queer as
a spidereen! Celia won’t vote for her, I know that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bet I can make Celia vote for her. I know a
way!” and Dotty wagged her head wisely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was too busy thinking to ask what the way
was. “You see,” she went on, “we mustn’t let Bernice
know we’re getting votes for her, or she’ll get
mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she needn’t know it, but we ought to get
right at it, Doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; let’s go to see the Rawlins now.”</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was uphill work from the beginning. The two
D’s canvassed the whole class, and found the tide of
prejudice strongly against Bernice for President.
This was no more than they had expected, and they
set bravely to work to induce individual members to
change their minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover the Brown boys declined to help. They
were good chums of the two D’s, and they rather
liked Bernice, at times, but they didn’t want her for
Class President. They were nice about it, but very
decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Lollie Henry was the only boy whom they could
depend on for assistance. But he was willing to do
anything, and expressed an intention of punching
the heads of the fellows who refused to do as he advised
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t do that, Lollie,” said Dolly, laughing
to think what means were being proposed to aid her
to gain her point. “Never mind using such strong
measures,—just persuade them by argument.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know the fellows as I do, Dolly. They
won’t listen to argument, and you just <span class='it'>have</span> to punch
them. But I’ll do it gently, if you say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bribe them,” advised Dotty. “I got Minnie
Dorlon over by giving her my fountain pen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bribery and corruption!” exclaimed Lollie.
“That is much worse then punching heads!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all ways are all right, if they work,” Dolly
declared. “The little bribes we offer won’t hurt
anybody. I’m going to get Celia Ferris’s vote by
means of my portfolio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dotty!” cried Dolly, “your new leather portfolio?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Celia is just daffy over it, and says she’ll
vote for Bernice if I give her that, and on no other
condition. Oh, I don’t mind. And it’s no harm to
bribe in a little election like this. If the girls want
these things, they might as well have ’em, and then
we get their votes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bad idea,” said Lollie, musingly. “I bet
Jim Lee would vote for anybody, if I gave him my
last year’s skates. And I don’t want them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it,” said Dotty. “Try every means,
Lollie, and then we <span class='it'>must</span> get the election.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice knew that she was a candidate for the
Presidency, but she did not know how Dolly and
Dotty were working for her election. She remarked
to Dolly, that if she should be made President of the
class she should consider it a mark of popularity
more than almost anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll remember our bargain,” said Dolly,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will. If I’m President, it’ll be because the
class likes me, of course, and I’m quite ready to admit
that I owe that liking in great part to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll do what you promised?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will. I can easily make father arrange
for your father to stay here. I sounded him,
and I found out he’ll do it if I say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bernice, then I think you might do it, whether
you get elected or not! For I’ve done everything
I could for you, and I can’t help the result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and Bernice shut her lips tightly together;
“I won’t speak to father about it at all, if I’m not
made President. A bargain is a bargain.”</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>So Dolly redoubled her efforts. But the trouble
was, the opposing candidate was a favourite of all,
Molly Mooney, a girl who lived over on the other
side of town, was not in the Two D’s set, but she was
a merry, good-natured girl, whom everybody liked.
And so, many of the class declared their intention of
voting for Molly Mooney, and couldn’t be persuaded
to alter their decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very trying situation, for Dolly couldn’t
explain <span class='it'>why</span> she was so desperately anxious to have
Bernice elected; and many of her best friends laughingly
refused to listen when she urged them to vote
on her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contest promised to be a close one. Up to
the very day of the election, Dolly and Dotty never
ceased trying to turn the tide in their favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls felt sure they would win, but Lollie
said he was doubtful. He had persuaded Joe Collins
to help him in his electioneering, and Joe was doing
it for the fun of the thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care a red cent,” Joe said, “who is President.
It’s only a figurehead position anyway, when
a girl holds it. The Committee decides everything.
But if you two girls want Bernice so terribly, why
I’ll help all I can. She is in our set, and Molly
Mooney isn’t. Though Molly is an awful nice girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Joe hustled around, and announced the day of
the election, that he had secured two more votes that
morning. “But some are backing out,” he added.
“The fellows promise, and they go back on their
word. Awful mean, but they do, all the same. Now,
Hy Landon, he told me yesterday he’d vote for Bernice,
and to-day he told Lollie he didn’t intend to at
all! So you can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The election was to take place directly after school
was out in the afternoon. All day, Dolly and Dotty
were in a state of nervous excitement. Usually most
exemplary of conduct in school hours, this day found
them writing notes and whispering in the class rooms,
and so preoccupied were they with the one idea, that
each missed a lesson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” poor Dolly thought to herself, “it doesn’t
matter if I do miss my lessons, if I’ve got to move
away from Berwick!” and then the tears would force
themselves to her eyes, and she had to dab furtively
with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After school, the two candidates went home. It
was not the custom for them to stay to the election.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Molly Mooney went off, laughing, and calling back
to her friends to stand by her, and elect her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice, on the other hand, walked off without a
word; her head tossing haughtily, as if she had no
concern in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst thing she could do!” fumed Dotty.
“The ones ‘on the fence’ will be put out at her manner,
and will vote for Molly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some other business was transacted and then the
election began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even at the last minute a note was thrust into
Dotty’s hand. It was from Tod Brown and it
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I vote for Bernice, will you give me all the
dances at the High School Christmas Dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How perfectly ridiculous!” exclaimed Dotty to
herself. And looking over at Tod, she said a noiseless
but unmistakable “No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Tod signalled back, “then I vote for
Molly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goodness!” thought the distracted Dotty,
“what shall I do? It would be idiotic to dance every
dance with him, and yet—if it means the casting
vote—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hastily scribbled a note which said, “I’ll give
you half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honest?” asked Tod, from across the room.
“Cross your heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily Dotty “crossed her heart” and Tod signified
assent to voting for her candidate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” Dotty reasoned, “if Bernice isn’t elected
and Dolly goes away, I shan’t go to the dance. And
if Dolly stays, I’ll be so glad I won’t care <span class='it'>who</span> I dance
with!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The votes were taken and the tellers went into
another room to count up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathlessly the Two D’s awaited the result. It
seemed as if the word would never come. At last, the
door opened and the tellers came back. As soon as
she saw their jubilant faces, Dolly knew her doom.
They all wanted Molly, and it must be that Molly
was elected judging from their smiling looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And sure enough, the result, as stated, was that
Molly Mooney was elected Class President by a majority
of three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How awfully close!” said everybody, and there
was general rejoicing, for many of those who had
promised to vote for Bernice and who did vote for
her, really preferred Molly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly said no word, but went to the cloakroom for
her wraps. Dotty followed and two more gloomy,
sad little countenances you never saw. They started
homeward, alone, for they had hastened out before
the others who went their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you going?” said Dotty, as Dolly turned
a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see Bernice. I told her I’d come and tell her
the result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want me to go with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. Oh, Dot, she’ll be awful mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, but we did our best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter. She’ll be mad at me, all
the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bernice was. When the girls told her that
Molly was Class President, she turned on Dolly like
a little termagant. “I knew you couldn’t run that
thing, Dolly Fayre! You think yourself so smart,
bossing everybody around, but you couldn’t do just
that one little thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you talk like that, Bernice,” said Dotty,
herself quite as angry. “Dolly worked like everything,
and so did I. If you aren’t the most popular
girl in the class, we can’t help it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you can’t,” said Bernice, dully, “but
Dolly <span class='it'>said</span> she could. That’s what makes me mad;
she said she’d accomplish something and she didn’t
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t, Bernice,” admitted Dolly, “and
I’m sorry. I suppose now you won’t ask your
father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I won’t! A bargain is a bargain. I
said if I won the election, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I didn’t win it, did I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s all there is about it, <span class='it'>I</span> think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re not going to ask your father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to ask my father anything. You
haven’t done what you said you would, for me, and
I’m not bound to do anything for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Bernice, good-bye,” and Dolly got up
and left the room and went out of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so blinded by her irrepressible tears, that
she didn’t notice that Dotty wasn’t with her. She
stumbled home, and going to her room, she flung herself
on her bed and had her cry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she got up, bathed her eyes, and sat down to
think it over. But there seemed to be nothing more
to think of. She had tried her best and had failed.
There was no other way to try, and no hope for remaining
in Berwick now. To be sure she had said
she would appeal to Mr. Forbes for her father’s retention
in his present position, but that plan didn’t
seem right, and she abandoned it.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, Dotty had stayed behind with Bernice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do anything you please,” Dotty said,
her eyes blazing with anger, “but I’m going to tell
you what I think of you! The idea of letting Dolly
Fayre do all she has done for you and then refusing
to use your influence with your father for her just because
you lost the election! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t only that, but Dolly said she would make
me one of the most popular girls in town and she
hasn’t done it. A bargain is a—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that over again! You make me so
mad. I <span class='it'>know</span> a bargain is a bargain, but of course
all Dolly could do, was to <span class='it'>try</span> to make you popular,
and she has done that. If she couldn’t succeed, it’s
your fault, not hers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve tried too, Dotty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this speech muttered in an humble voice, Dotty
looked up in astonishment. Had she struck a right
chord at last?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you, Bernie?” she said gently. “Perhaps
if we <span class='it'>all</span> tried again, we might yet win out. Not the
presidency, that’s settled, but there are other sorts of
popularity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I don’t care so much about the election,
but it shows that nobody likes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it doesn’t. It shows that you’re very nearly
as popular as Molly Mooney. For there was only a
majority of three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only three! Why, you didn’t tell me that!
Why, Dotty, if that’s all the difference there was in
the count, it’s almost as good as being elected! Only
<span class='it'>three</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s all. I didn’t know you’d care what
the count was, if you didn’t win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course I care! Don’t you see that to
come as close as that, shows that lots of them did
want me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty knew it didn’t show quite this, but still it was
an indication of willingness to have Bernice, no matter
for what reason. She followed up the advantage.
“Then Bernice, if you realise that, don’t you see that
next time it might be a winning vote for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it encourages me to keep on trying. Oh,
Dotty, I have tried,—tried, I mean, to be so nice
and gay and pleasant that they would like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you have, Bernice. And I want you to
promise me to keep on trying. Now, see here, give
Dolly and me another chance. You bargained with
her that she should have till the first of January to
keep her part of the bargain. Now, here you’re
turning her down in the middle of December!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so. That isn’t fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t. And you’re always fair. Will you
stick to your own bargain, and give her till the first of
the New Year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will. You tell her so. And, say,
Dotty, I do want to do this thing right, you know.
I want to be liked for myself, not because Dolly’s
booming me. Don’t you think I can?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can, Bernie. You’ve only to be
your own self,—your nicest self, you know,—and
not give way to those stuck-up airs you used to show
so much. Just be affable and willing to chum, and
people will like you fast enough. Now, I must run.
I want to tell Dolly what you’ve said, before she
cries her eyes out. Good-bye, and thank you lots for
this little talk,—we’ll have another some day soon.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CARNIVAL QUEEN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Father</span>,” said Bernice Forbes as the two sat at
dinner that night, “are you a popular man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul, Bernie! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that, Dad. Are you popular among your
friends and business associates?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s a leading question, my girl; and I’m
not sure I want to answer it. For, to tell the truth,
Daughter, I’m not so very popular,—as popularity
goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why aren’t you?” and Bernice looked serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you asking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a good reason, Daddy. Please tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, Bernie, I’m not popular because I’m
not willing to forget myself. To be honest, I’m a
man of decided opinions,—among others, a pretty
good opinion of myself,—and that sort of a nature
doesn’t command admiration from the crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you care, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much. I feel sometimes as if I’d like to be
more chummy with my men friends; then I’m apt to
say something to provoke them, and they rather
evade me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad, that’s just my case. But I <span class='it'>do</span> want to be
popular. In school I mean,—and with the boys and
girls. I’ve never been a favourite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Well, you can be, easily enough, if you
choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simply by being agreeable always. And by
agreeable, I don’t mean plausibly polite, I mean actually
to <span class='it'>agree</span> with people. With what they say
and what they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether I mean it, or not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! I don’t want you to tell falsehoods, of
course. But if some one says, ‘I just adore sunflowers,
don’t you?’ and you hate them, you needn’t
say, ‘No, I detest the horrid things!’ but you can
say, ‘They’re such a brilliant yellow,’ or ‘They do
grow very tall,’ or something generally acquiescent,
instead of flatly disagreeing. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some. And if anybody raves over a girl that I
dislike, I suppose I can keep my mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than that. You can surely find something
nice to say about the girl, even if you dislike other
traits she has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose I could. And if the girls do things
that I can’t abide, I ’spect I can at least refrain from
criticism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that isn’t enough, Bernie. You must seem
to <span class='it'>like</span> them, unless, of course, it’s something really
wrong. But if it’s only a habit or a mannerism or
a fashion, smile at it, and agree, even if your own
private opinion is just the opposite. This is simple
tact,—and will win popularity for you sooner than
anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something in what you say, Father. I’ve
always held out for my own opinions and tastes in
the most unimportant matters, and I see now, that’s
one reason why they call me ‘stuck-up’ and
‘proudy.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Forbes smiled. “I remember from my own
schooldays, those are the most awful faults a child
can have. I advise you, Honey, to quit such an attitude,
and acquire the habit of agreeing. If Maisie
May likes blue hair-ribbons and you like pink, say
the blue are pretty. That can’t hurt your conscience,
for they <span class='it'>are</span> pretty. And it will make
Maisie feel far more friendly, than if you deride the
blue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Dad, your hair-ribbon example is a
silly one, but it does express the idea. I’ve been too
dictatorial, and self-sufficient. Now, I’m going to
turn over a new leaf. I’m going to agree with everybody—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In trifles, Bernie. Don’t go so far as to misrepresent
yourself in any matter of importance or
any question of right or wrong. If any one tells
you it’s a fine day you needn’t say <span class='it'>you</span> think it raw
and disagreeable. But if any one says it’s a fine day,
and it’s pouring buckets,—then say it’s raining and
stick to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, Dad,” and Bernice laughed. “I’ve got
sense enough to understand what you mean. And
I’m going to profit by it. Is this the sort of thing
you don’t do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it is, girlie. I have a naturally contrary
disposition, and if any one says anything, it’s
my first impulse to contradict him. I’ve tried to correct
this, but I’m too old a dog to learn new tricks.
But you’re young, and you ought to mend your ways,
where mending is needed. Myself,—I think you’re
perfect, just as you are,” and Mr. Forbes smiled
fondly at his pretty daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old Dad! But I might be a better girl if
you taught me more about behaviour and such things,
than if you just approve of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t do it, Honey. To me you’re a piece of
perfection,—the apple of my eye. And all I ask
is that you shall be happy and have everything you
want. Is there anything I can give you, Dearie,
that you don’t possess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you dear old Father. But some day, soon,
perhaps, I may ask a favour of you, a strange one,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, it’s granted in advance. To the half
of my kingdom,—and then, the other half!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice was right. It would have been far better
if Mr. Forbes had exercised a kind supervision over
his daughter and her ways, instead of giving her this
unquestioning approbation. But such was his nature,
and the motherless girl suffered in consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Bernice took to heart her father’s talk
about being agreeable, and began at once to put it
in practice. She was astonished to find how easy it
was. Often she stifled an impulse to contradict, and
discovered that she could honestly agree just as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was slow work. Nobody seemed ready to
meet her half-way. Even the Two D’s had become
disheartened, for the girls and boys tired of showing
Bernice attention just because Dolly and Dotty asked
them to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And about a week before the Christmas holidays,
Mr. Fayre told his family that they might as well
begin to pack up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing more will be said until after January
first,” he remarked, “but there seems no hope of a
change of plans. You know what Forbes is. I’d
rather not speak to him on the subject, and get
snubbed for my pains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you might just ask him, Father,” said
Trudy. “I hate to resign from my club and give up
my place on the Concert Committee, unless we’re
surely going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may as well give them up, Trudy,” answered
her father, “for we’re sure to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” asked Dolly, with a quivering lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the middle of January, dear. I’m very
sorry for you, Dolly, girlie, but you can have Dotty
to visit you a lot, and you can visit her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Treasure House?” said Dolly, in a broken
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we’ll turn over to Dotty. We can’t very
well take it with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Daddy, it will <span class='it'>kill</span> me!” and Dolly flung
herself into her father’s arms in a paroxysm of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, dear little girl, it <span class='it'>is</span> terribly hard,
I know. But try to bear it, my darling little daughter.
I’ll do anything I can for you, to make up.
Perhaps you can have another Treasure House in
Buffalo. But not unless we’re fairly sure of staying
there permanently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t <span class='it'>want</span> another Treasure House! Nor
another Dotty! I just want <span class='it'>this</span> House and <span class='it'>this</span>
Dotty! Oh, I can’t <span class='it'>stand</span> it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long time before they could quiet the
nervous and heartbroken child. At last, quite worn
out, she went to bed, but not to sleep. She lay there,
“thinking it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must manage it somehow,” she kept saying to
herself. “There’s Bernice, she could keep us here
by a single word to her father, and she won’t do it.
I’ve done all I possibly can to make her popular,
what more could I do? It seems so silly to have my
whole life’s happiness hang on the word of that girl!
But if it does hang there, why <span class='it'>can’t</span> I pick it off?
Why, oh, <span class='it'>why</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tossing and tumbling in her little white bed, Dolly
put in an awful night. At last one little forlorn
hope came to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can do that,” she thought, seeing a tiny ray
of hope, “Bernice will surely agree that I have kept
my part of the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought and thought. She planned and
planned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, though it was two o’clock in the morning,
she jumped out of bed and throwing on her dressing-gown,
sat at her desk and wrote a long letter to Bert
and another to Bob Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went back to bed, and after a short time
sleep came to ease the poor little worried mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days flew by. The cold weather continued,
and skating was the delight of all the young people.
Bernice was a fine skater, and close watch on the part
of Dolly and Dotty showed that she had partners for
the skating parties far oftener than she used to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This favoured Dolly’s new plan, the same being
nothing more nor less than to have Bernice chosen
Queen of the Carnival, which on Christmas Eve was
to be the great celebration of the holiday season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A skating carnival had not been possible for many
years, but the exceptionally cold winter had made it
feasible this season, and all the young people of Berwick
were wildly enthusiastic over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tad and Tod Brown were willing this time to consent
to the request of the Two D’s to vote for Bernice
as Carnival Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a bang-up skater,” said Tad; “the best in
Berwick, I think. And, another thing, Bernie is a
heap nicer than she used to be. She’s come down off
her high horse, and almost never rubs in her wealth
and grandeur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She <span class='it'>is</span> nicer,” agreed Tod. “She doesn’t snap a
fellow up, everything he says, and she smiles more,
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was as balm to Dolly’s soul. She rejoiced
to hear the boys speak thus of Bernice. Then she
had cold chills, lest, since Bernice was winning praise
by her own improvement, she might conclude that
Dolly had no hand in it, and therefore had not won
her promised reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the two indefatigable workers kept on. They
were more wary than they had been when trying to
get Bernice made class President, for in this instance,
many were concerned beside their class in High
School. So they worked quietly, even secretly, but
they urged many to vote for Bernice as Queen of the
Carnival, and partly owing to the position and influence
of Mr. Forbes, many expressed themselves as
more than willing to consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hopes of the Two D’s ran high. Dolly’s letters
to the two boys had resulted in their influencing
a number of boys in Berwick whom the girls did not
know well enough to speak to about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, when the question came up before the committee,
public spirit was so much in favour of Bernice
that she was chosen Queen by a large majority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” sighed Dolly in absolute content, when she
heard of it. “I <span class='it'>am</span> so glad! Is it really true?
Dotty, we’ve won something, anyway! I don’t know
whether Bernie will feel that <span class='it'>I</span> did anything to help,
but I did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet you did!” cried Dotty, “and I’ll see to
it that Bernice knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful,—you know she hates to owe it to my
efforts—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that was her bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but still, she squirms when she thinks I
just plain coax people to be nice to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think she would! Isn’t it horrid, Doll,
to win favour that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, it seems so to us; but you know how
Bernie is. I suppose, Dot, if she had a mother like
the rest of us have, she’d be different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’pose so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night of the carnival came. A perfect night,
clear, cold, and illuminated by a kindly moon, which
was somewhat eclipsed by the lights that surrounded
and glorified the little Berwick lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decorations were elaborate, and the committee
in charge were justly proud of their display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob and Bert were home for their holiday, and
were eager to know the result of the campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” declared Dolly. “Bernie was chosen by
a big majority and she’ll be a stunning Queen. She’s
going to wear white velvet and ermine,—real ermine!
Won’t she be beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was beautiful. The costume, though magnificent,
was none too grand for a carnival queen; and
better than that, the face, under the crown of gold
filigree, tipped with white ostrich feathers, was sweet
and smiling, and showed only kindly and merry impulses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly, as she herself dressed for the carnival, was
distinctly nervous and apprehensive. Bernice had
been so busy getting ready for the event and attending
to its details, that Dolly hadn’t seen her alone for
weeks. She couldn’t say exactly that Bernice had
avoided her, but they had not been thrown together,
and Dolly had no idea whether Bernice intended to
carry out her part of the contract or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She feared <span class='it'>not</span>; and it was with a heavy heart that
she donned her pretty skating costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was of light blue cloth, banded with silver
fox. A cap to match sat jauntily on the golden
curls, and it was a lovely reflection that looked back
at her from her mirror. But Dolly cared little for
her own appearance, so unnerved was she over the uncertainty
that still hung over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Dotty, next door, was also dressing for
the carnival. Her costume was of red broadcloth,
with dark fur trimmings. It was of Russian effect,
and suited well the rosy beauty of the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, was thoughtful. At last she exclaimed,
“I can’t <span class='it'>stand</span> it!” and throwing aside the cap she
was about to don, she flew down to the library and
snatched up the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bernice,” she said, after she got the connection,
“I <span class='it'>must</span> ask you. Are you going to ask your father,—you
know what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Bernice, so full of her own affairs,
she really didn’t think what Dotty had in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>do</span> know. About—somebody’s staying in
Berwick, instead of going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that. Well, I can’t bother about it now.
Yes, I’ll do it,—some time or other. But I don’t
know as—somebody—had such a lot to do with this
carnival business—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, somebody <span class='it'>did</span>! Now, you just catch on to
this! If somebody <span class='it'>hadn’t</span>, you wouldn’t be—what
you are to-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk so plain—over the telephone! I’ll
see you later—”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t! You’ll settle this here and now,
or—you’ll be sorry! I tell you she did her part and
more than her part. You said, yourself, a bargain’s
a bargain. Now you’ve got to keep your word, or—I’ll
make you sorry that she kept hers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this. If you don’t do what you promised—right
now,—I’ll tell everybody how you happened to
be Queen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Dotty, don’t talk so plain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, will you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask your father—you know what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,—I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not <span class='it'>now</span>. To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, <span class='it'>now</span>! You go straight to him, and fix
it up, or I’ll do what I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, what an impatient—” and just then
it struck Bernice that she was to agree with people!
“All right, Dotsie,” she said with such a sudden
change of intonation that Dotty nearly fell off her
chair. “I’ll go right now. You hang up, and I’ll
call you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, honest and truly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dotty waited. In a short time the telephone hell
rang, and Bernice said, “It’s all right. Dad says
he can arrange it as easy as pie. He didn’t know
they wanted to stay here so much. Shall I tell
Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, let me tell her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Rather you would. I’m fearfully
busy. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernice was evidently preoccupied with her preparations,
but Dotty didn’t care now. They had won!
Mr. Forbes had given his word, and all was well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flinging on her cap, that was part of her costume,
Dotty flew over to Dolly’s like a small but very energetic
whirlwind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up the stairs she bounded, and into Dolly’s room.
She grabbed her round the neck and kissed her frantically,
while she cried, “It’s all right! We’ve won!
Mr. Forbes says you can stay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” and Dolly’s blue eyes opened wide in
glad surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and Trudy heard the commotion, and came
from their rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Dotty whispered, still holding Dolly tight.
“It’s all right, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all right?” asked Trudy, looking at the
two beaming girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Trude,” said Bert, catching on.
“Leave the kiddies alone,—they’ve got a secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert led Trudy away, and laughingly put her back
in her own room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went to Dolly’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Dot? Honestly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>yes</span>, YES! Oh, isn’t it grand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Dotty told of her telephone talk with
Bernice, and how Mr. Forbes had willingly agreed to
let Mr. Fayre stay in the New York office, and continue
to live in Berwick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hooray!” cried Bert, grabbing off the two girls’
caps and flinging them to the ceiling. “Hadn’t a
cap on, so had to take yours! I say, you two are
bricks! How ever <span class='it'>did</span> you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you all about it to-morrow,” said Dotty smiling.
“We must get off to the carnival now, if we’re
going at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on,” said Dolly, still a little bewildered with
delight. “I must tell Dad and Mumsie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Dotty, “and Trudy, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The joyful news was spread abroad, and great rejoicing
was in the house of Fayre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly made a clean breast of the whole matter,
and though Mr. Fayre was dumfounded, he couldn’t
suppress his laughter at the way his daughter had
manœuvred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a case, Dollygirl!” he exclaimed. “I’ll
see Mr. Forbes about this to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ll stay in Berwick, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, we’ll stay in Berwick. I think Berwick
has earned the honour of your citizenship as long as
you live. Dolly, you have surprised me,—you certainly
have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where <span class='it'>are</span> you people?” called Bob Rose from
the hall. “It’s time to start!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was just then smothered in her mother’s embrace.
She lifted her beaming face, and called out,
“All right, Bob. Coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with gay laughter, the Rose-Fayre quartette
started off, secure in the knowledge that they were
all four, permanent citizens of the town of Berwick!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
